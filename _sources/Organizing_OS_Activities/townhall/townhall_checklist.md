# Town Hall Checklist 

Looking to organize a town hall to discuss open science with your team or community? Here are some tips to get started! 

## Why do a Town Hall? 
The tradition of town halls dates back to the 17th century, when an entire town would get together to debate new rules, share news, and make decisions that would affect the entire community (source: [*When the People Speak*](https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/acprof:osobl/9780199604432.001.0001)). A modern town hall meeting often has elements of presentations, panel discussions, and community feedback. They can be a powerful tool to understand the climate around a particular issue, get the community excited, and drive participation in particular initiatives.  

### Lead with Purpose
A town hall meeting ideally ends with either a decision being made OR feedback being gathered on a previous decision. In your open science town hall, this decision could be changing team rules to allow for pre-prints, mandate sharing of code immediately upon publication of research, or convincing folks to sign up for open science training. The purpose may also be getting feedback on an open science action plan (TOPS' example is [here](/Open_Science_Cookbook/Your_Organizations_Open_Science_Journey.md), jump ahead to section titled "Develop Governance Frameworks and Policies"), or hearing from a group of open science experts on different open science strategies that may work for your team, and then discussing as a group which of those strategies you will adopt.

     - [ ] Prepare panelists, including any information to help prepare for questions
     - [ ] Virtual event staff: chat monitor, raised-hand monitor, note-taker, tech assistance

     - [ ] Prepare any materials to be distributed 
     - [ ] Promote your event! Put it in a community newsletter, blast an email, put it on your socials, etc. This should include creating a calendar invite and a registration form 
- [ ] One Month Before the Event
     - [ ] More event promotion (send out the registration form again)
     - [ ] If appropriate, create a press kit or materials to go on your organization's website 
     - [ ] Verify that your event is an accessible as possible: does the event space need ramps? Will everyone be able to hear the speaker or read the slides? If virtual, will closed captioning be available? 
- [ ] Two Weeks Before the Event: Send out an event reminder, post any supporting materials online  
- [ ] Two Days Before the Event: Send out an event reminder, flag event on your socials
- [ ] Have the event!
