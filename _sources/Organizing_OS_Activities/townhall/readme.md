# Organize a TOPS Town Hall Event
*Want to host a town hall about open science or invite TOPS to participate at your next event? Here is how!*

- Examples of successful town hall submissions are provided in this [folder](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/blob/main/Organizing_OS_Activities/townhall).
- Tips and a checklist for getting started with your own town hall can be found [here](./townhall_checklist.md).
- TOPS decks can be found on our [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/communities/tops/?page=1&size=20). Some of our favorites are [NASA Open-Source Science Initiative: Transform to OPen Science](https://zenodo.org/record/5621674), [Opening up to Open Science](https://zenodo.org/record/6536834) and [NASA's SMD Transform to Open Science Initiative](https://zenodo.org/record/6543148/files/PitchDeck_YOOS_PUBLIC.pdf?download=1).
