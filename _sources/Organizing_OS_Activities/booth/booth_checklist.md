# Booth Checklist
 
All conferences have a team of professionals who are ready to answer your questions, including those about pricing plans, the do's and don'ts of the conference space, and the optimal location for your booth on the conference floor. While specifics vary from conference to conference, TOPS has created the following guide to get you started.
 
Adapted from [Neuronline's](https://neuronline.sfn.org/outreach/how-to-run-a-booth-at-a-public-event) article, "How to Run a Booth at a Public Event."
 
### 1. Purchase Booth Space
 
If you've got a conference in mind, it is important to check its details page early to make sure you get a booth space. Some events require you to purchase the booth almost a year in advance; others will prioritize their event sponsors and then sell the remaining space a few weeks before conference start-date. 
 
Start by determining the cost of the booth. Don't forget that you may have to pay a deposit upfront to hold your space. 
 
Decide what size booth you’ll need; this will vary depending on what you plan to bring or how many people will be staffing the booth at a time. Most booths measure 10 square feet (a single booth) or 10x20 feet (a double booth).
 
In our new, hybrid era, there may be an option for a virtual booth space. This feels a bit like a customer-service-equipped web-page, with a chat for communicating with your virtual booth visitors, plenty of spaces for thought pieces, clips, and other online collateral, as well as a "video chat room" using Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Webex or some other video-meeting software to hold a space for any virtual visitors. The American Meteorological Society (AMS) has virtual booth spaces for their 2023 conference, which provides a good benchmark for pricing, as well as what exhibitors can expect. You can find their materials [here](https://annual.ametsoc.org/index.cfm/2022/exhibitors/).
 
### 2. Order What You’ll Need
 
First, determine whether your event space is providing tables, chairs, wastebaskets, carpeting, space dividers or other booth materials. Determine what you need to make your space attractive to participants as well as comfortable for you and your staff. If you’ll need electricity to run any of your activities, let the event organizer know, as you may have to order it, or bring extension cords. 
 
Lead retrievals--which often take the form of a physical scanner or a smartphone app--may also be available and can be used to scan attendees’ badges for following up after the event. If your event isn't providing this, make sure you have a mechanism for determining who came to your booth and for contacting them after. 
 
For large events, there is usually a “show company” that will ship your materials to and from the event. Determine if there is a separate company, and if so, ask them for an estimated shipping cost.
 
### 3. Decide What to Bring
 
With about two or three months to go, think about the types of materials or activities you’ll have and how many of each you’ll need. Consider the audience; for example, if the event is for kids, bring plenty of games, in contrast, if mostly adults will be at the event, just a sample or two of your materials may be sufficient. 
 
Common collateral includes one-pagers or pamphlets but also stickers, pens, pencils, notebooks, postcards, water bottles, rulers, tote bags, laser pointers, and (a personal favorite) multi-tools. Free food is a powerful motivator. Put in any orders early, and verify the address to which they are arriving -- if something is going straight to the event venue, make sure to verify which name ought to be on the package. If it is coming to you, leave plenty of time to receive it before you travel.
 
### 4. Promote Your Booth
 
Don’t forget to get the word out! With all of the work you’ve put into planning your booth, this step is crucial for letting interested audiences know you’ll be at the event. 
 
Social media can allow you to reach many people at once. Post several times in the months leading up to the event, using attractive images and engaging text to capture people’s attention. Tease what you’ll be bringing and what attendees can learn, and show you’re excited to be going, too!

### 5. Recruit Help & Register for the Event
 
With two months to go, determine how many people from your organization will be needed to run the booth. The more activities you plan to have on site, the more people will need to be there. Ideally, at least one person would be assigned to an individual activity. 
 
Reach out to the folks you have in mind to help you, and make sure they are registered for the event and have the necessary travel details. Note, some conferences will include complementary registration for those helping with a booth, while others do not. Try to take advantage of early-bird pricing, particularly if you have been planning your presence for a while. 
 
### 6. Create the Final Packing List
 
About a month before the event, create the final packing list. Ask another person to look over it, and leave plenty of time to pack — it can often take longer than expected. 
 
If you haven't ordered your collateral, be sure to get that in and see about shipping it straight to the event venue. 
 
### 7. Set Up and Run Your Booth
 
Most conferences designate a specific block of time for exhibitors to set up their booth. Take advantage of this time to design your display so it’s visually appealing and inviting to attendees who may be walking by. Arrange a break schedule for your volunteers so that folks can leave to use the restroom, eat, or enjoy the conference.
 
Make sure to designate someone to gather the details of those who stop by, whether it is using a badge scanner, collecting emails, or directing people to a particular QR-code or website. This person should also collect business cards, or hand out the business cards of your organization. 
 
### 8. Post-Event Reminders
 
After the event, return any materials you ordered or borrowed, including badge scanners, extension cords, tables, chairs and trash/recycling cans. 
 
If you scanned badges, send a follow-up email to those who stopped by your booth and may want to learn more about your topic.
