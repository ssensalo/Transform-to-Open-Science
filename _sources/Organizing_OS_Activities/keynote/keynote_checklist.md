# Keynote Checklist

Have you been invited to present a keynote on scientific research that utilized open science (or the benefits and adoption of open science more broadly)? Congratulations! The following checklist may help you get started. And [let us know](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1XcjQU9vYyXAMmJFdB6H021PFypGYWbNKvNR_em5q2UY/edit) when you'll be presenting, we'd love to amplify your event! 

The following has been adopted from [Piktochart's](https://piktochart.com/blog/tips-keynote-presentation/) "10 Expert Tips to Create and Deliver a Killer Keynote Presentation", [Marilynn Larkin's](https://www.elsevier.com/connect/how-to-give-a-dynamic-scientific-presentation) "How to give a dynamic scientific presentation", [Joanne Kamens'](https://blog.addgene.org/10-steps-to-a-perfect-science-talk) "Ten Steps to a Perfect Science Talk," and [Vanessa Van Edwards'](https://www.scienceofpeople.com/how-to-give-captivating-presentations/) "How to give captivating presentations."

### 1. Begin with your main message (and repeat it often)
It can be tempting to dive right into crafting your slides, but it is important to have a firm grasp of your main message before you decide how you will convey that message to the audience. Think about the theme of the conference and, if applicable, what other materials your research team or organization will be showing at that conference. Are you connecting to that overarching message? Make sure you come back to the main message multiple times during your keynote, so that if they remember nothing else, they remember that!

### 2. Know your audience
Once you've considered what *you* want to share during the keynote, consider the audience. Are they researchers, funders, policy-makers, members of the interested public, students or some other stakeholder in your work? What academic backgrounds can you expect? How do you expect them to use the information you are providing? Consider your main message again; how will you make your message compelling for *this* audience?
* Pro Tip: Keep it simple and clear by avoiding jargon, defining any acronyms in your slides, and citing references. 

### 3. Do not bury the lead
Often, advice for presentations begins by advising the presenter to tell a compelling story at the start of their speech. While drawing the audience into the talk is important, be sure to tell the audience what "is in it for them" right at the start. Be careful not to spend so much time on story-telling that the message gets lost. 
That doesn't mean ignore story-telling completely, however! Strong presentations have a clear beginning, middle, and end, and (if possible) should refer to the same anecdote or case study to keep the audience engaged. 
* Pro Tip: The [article](https://www.elsevier.com/connect/how-to-give-a-dynamic-scientific-presentation) "How to Give a Dynamic Scientific Presentation" by Marilynn Larkin suggests to structure a presentation by establishing context, framing the problem, providing highlights of the solution (tied to the audience's expertise, if possible), and then wrapping up by summarizing key points and thanking collaborators. 
* Pro Tip: The [blog post](https://blogs.nature.com/naturejobs/2013/02/17/how-to-communicate-your-work-through-stories/) by Catherine de Lange, "How to communicate your work through stories," walks the reader through the use of stories to captivate and convince your audience.

### 4. Get creative with images...but not too creative
"Pictures are worth a thousand words;" but, you want to make sure the pictures are not distracting from your message. Choose images that are simple in composition (aka "not too busy") and connect thematically to your talk. The same goes for graphs, charts, and any other figures; simple graphics are better, and keep in mind the technical level and background of the audience. 

### 5. Practice, practice, practice!
It's the oldest trick in the book but it really works! If you are reworking an old presentation, give your new version to someone who didn't hear the original, to make sure the story still feels consistent. For more tips on giving your presentation, check out ["How to Give a Dynamic Scientific Presentation](https://www.elsevier.com/connect/how-to-give-a-dynamic-scientific-presentation)."
* Pro Tip: Try to predict the questions your audience may ask and prepare some answers to them. Better yet, ask a friend or colleague to watch you practice, and have them ask you their hardest questions! 

### 6. Be in the moment, be enthusiastic, and act confident!
No matter the audience, they will be excited by your keynote if *you* are excited about your keynote! This excitement can be conveyed through the images on the screen, your tone/inflection or voice volume, or your body language. This is called "stage presence" and it is a skill that must be practiced -- so be sure to practice the presentation in the form you will be giving it. Will you be on stage with a big screen? Project your presentation on your home TV and pretend your living room is the stage. Giving the talk virtually? Practice it in your favorite web-meeting software so that you can get used to looking at the web-cam. 

## Checklist
- [ ] Logistics
     - [ ] How long do you have to speak? 
     - [ ] Is the keynote online or in-person? If in-person, will you have a mic, white-board, projector, etc? 
     - [ ] Does the keynote include Q&A? 
     - [ ] Are you providing slides? If yes, how many slides? 
     - [ ] What time is the presentation (If you're early in the morning, can the event provide donuts and coffee to get folks to your talk? If it's the last event of the conference, will there be a happy hour after to entice folks to stay?)   
- [ ] Main Message
     - [ ] What is your main message? 
     - [ ] How does your message affect your audience? How does it benefit them? 
     - [ ] What are the key three points of your message?

- [ ] Audience
     - [ ] What is the expected size of the audience? 
     - [ ] What is the academic background of the audience? How about work experience?
