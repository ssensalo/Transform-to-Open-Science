# Panel Checklist

Hoping to set up a panel on open science for yourself (or perhaps you were asked to help moderate one for someone else)? This guide includes tips, tricks, and a checklist both for an organizer and a potential panelist and moderator. 

## What is a panel discussion anyway? 
A panel discussion consists of a moderator (or presenter) who asks prepared questions to a group of experts (the "panel") so that the audience can hear varied experiences, opinions, and advice on a chosen topic. Panelists often comment on the responses of the other panelists, allowing for a more nuanced discussion. Panels tend to have between 3 and 5 experts, with the number varying on the amount of time allotted for the event, the subject being discussed, or simply the preference of the organizers. Some panels will also have an audience Q&A portion. 

There are two main types of panels: the Q&A format and the initial remarks format.
* The **Q&A Format** begins with the moderator introducing the topic, giving very brief introductions to the panelists, then diving into the prepared questions. The moderator may summarize the discussion at the end, ask for questions from the audience, or allow the panelists to each give a brief closing statement.  
* In the **Initial Remarks Format,** The moderator prompts the panelists to each introduce themselves at the start. Introductions can be as short as 2-minutes or as long as 10-minutes, depending on the time allotted for the overall event (some panel guides give strict instructions to not exceed 5-minutes, as you don't want to lose your audience). The moderator then asks the prepared questions, usually based on the content in the introduction. This may be followed by audience Q&A, before the moderator gives a closing statement. 
Both formats can be used in virtual and in-person events, although planning for these will necessarily look different. 

Whether using the Q&A format or the initial remarks format, it is recommended that slides be kept a minimum. For the Q&A format, a single slide that shows the name, title, and head-shot of each panelist (and the moderator, if there is room, and clearly mark them as the moderator) can be left up for the entire event. For the *initial remarks format* you may want to permit each speaker one slide if they are speaking for longer than five minutes, but try to provide a template, so that the slides feel thematically similar, and have them focus on the topic of the panel rather than their own CV.

## Panel Checklist
- [ ] Determine the **panel purpose** by asking the following questions:
     - [ ] Is this panel meant to inform or convince? 
     - [ ] How does the panel connect to the overall theme of the conference or event? 
     - [ ] How might your audience react to the panel topic or panelists themselves? 
     - [ ] Is the topic broad enough to appeal to a wide audience but narrow enough to intrigue experts? Does the topic connect to the overall conference theme? 
- [ ] **Tech Support**: what is the situation for the mic, visuals, and sound? 
     - [ ] If a virtual meeting, what is the virtual platform being used? Test the virtual meeting platform with the panelists to ensure everyone's system is ready.
     - [ ] If an in-person meeting, will individual mics be used or will one (or a couple) be passed back and forth? Who will set-up the mics and where does the moderator get them? Will slides be used during the in-person setting? If so, who will display them and advance the presentation?    
- [ ] Have you made the headshot slide? 
     - Whether in-person or virtual, it is suggested you have a single slide with the name, head-shot, and brief title or role of each panelist. If you have room, throw up the same for the moderator and mark them as the moderator. An example is [here](https://medium.com/hackernoon/how-to-organize-a-panel-676b9d82d678#6-background-signal-in-the-noise).
- [ ] Choose and prepare your **Moderator** using the following questions: 
     - [ ] Is the moderator neutral on the topic being discussed? If not, do they understand their role is to remain neutral and keep the conversation flowing? 
     - [ ] Is the moderator making opening or closing remarks? Do they know how long they have to make those remarks? Has the moderator provided bios for the speakers? 
     - [ ] Does the moderator have a mic (in-person) or the ability to mute/unmute themselves (virtual)? Do they have to pass the mic to the panelists (in-person) or mute/unmute panelists when it is their turn (virtual)? 
     - [ ] Does the moderator have the prepared questions? Are they able to add more questions if inspired? 
     - [ ] Can the moderator see the questions asked by the audience, if using a chat feature or other Q&A tool? Or will there be additional support to handle audience Q&A (surprise audience questions which cannot be curated in some way is discouraged, particularly if the audience is large) 
     - [ ] Additional tips for moderators can be [found here](https://kozyrkov.medium.com/public-speaking-masterclass-everything-in-moderation-ea286e0188d8)  
- [ ] Choose and prepare your **panelists** using the following: **Remember, mutual comfort zones are what dictates the topic of the panel - so choose the panelists carefully!**
     - [ ] Does the panel showcase a range of experiences, identities, professions and/or career levels? 
     - [ ] Do all the panelists agree or have the same opinion on everything; if so, how will you make the answers to panel questions compelling? 
     - [ ] Do all the panelists disagree on the topic? If so, does the moderator have a strategy for moving the conversation forward if "stalled" on one topic?  
     - [ ] Set-up a meeting where panelists can meet ahead of time  
- [ ] Q&A
     - [ ] Was the prepared Q&A shared with the panelists ahead of time? Were panelists able to contribute to the questions? 
     - [ ] Are you letting the audience ask questions? If so, are you using a chat feature to have them submit questions during the moderated portion, or will audience members walk up to a mic to ask questions? Do you need someone to unmute virtual participants to ask their question, or someone to run a mic back and forth in a conference room?
