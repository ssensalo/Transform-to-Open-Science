# Presentation Checklist

Planning on giving a presentation? We've curated a checklist to help you put together your **slides**! Looking for tips on giving the talk? Head over to the [keynote checklist](../keynote/keynote_checklist.md). 

The focus of this checklist is tips on creating a great slide deck that will support the story you are telling your audience. The tricky part is to balance "captivating" with "accessible." Slides with too many words aren't great, but slides with an over-complicated graphic could just as easily lose your audience. Color coding can convey a lot of information, but certain color schemes are hard to see for those with visual impairments.  

Here are a few videos we recommend:
* An in-depth walk-through of how to give great science presentations by Susan McConnell from Stanford University is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hp7Id3Yb9XQ). The video is almost 45 minutes long, so we recommend using the time-stamps in the video description to jump ahead to the part that interests you most. Some suggestions are [21:21 Minimum essential components](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hp7Id3Yb9XQ&t=1281s), [25:19 Structure of a good talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hp7Id3Yb9XQ&t=1519s), and [29:27 Meat & Taters; Keeping the audience's attention](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hp7Id3Yb9XQ&t=1767s).
* A brief crash-course in using PowerPoint to the fullest by Science Infographics is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hp7Id3Yb9XQ&t=1767s). This video is five-minutes long and has some great suggestions for using animations, shape tools, and other PowerPoint tricks to create a minimalist but informative talk. Google Slides has many of the same features, making the video fairly versatile. 

Here is some recommended reading:
* [Elie Diner](https://www.slide-talk.com/goal-slidetalk/), a science writer, has an entire blog about scientific presentations which begins [here](https://www.slide-talk.com/how-to-make-a-good-science-presentation/).
* Kevin D. Lafferty from the US Geological Survey, UC Santa Barbara but a cheat sheet together [here](https://parasitology.msi.ucsb.edu/sites/parasitology.msi.ucsb.edu/files/docs/publications/How%20to%20give%20a%20scientific%20presentation_0.pdf).
* The University of Colorado Boulder and Perkins School for the Blind both have resources on how to ensure you are creating slides which are accessible check them out [here](https://www.colorado.edu/digital-accessibility/resources/understanding-powerpoint-accessibility) and [here](https://www.perkins.org/resource/how-create-accessible-powerpoints/). 

Finally, David Nichols has created [a tool](https://davidmathlogic.com/colorblind/#%23D81B60-%231E88E5-%23FFC107-%23004D40) to help check if your color palette is color-blind friendly! We recommend reading the article as well as the tool itself. 

## Checklist

- [ ] Structure
     - [ ] Intro
     - [ ] Table of Contents
     - [ ] Introduce yourself (and your team)
     - [ ] "Main Idea" slide
     - [ ] Supporting idea slide(s)
     - [ ] Conclusion slide
     - [ ] Call to action slide (link your socials, team webpage etc)
     - [ ] Thank your partners/collaborators/conference organizers
     - [ ] Q&A slide 
- [ ] Beautification 
     - [ ] Consistent color palette (use [this tool](https://davidmathlogic.com/colorblind/#%23D81B60-%231E88E5-%23FFC107-%23004D40) to make sure it is accessible)
     - [ ] Consistent deck theme
     - [ ] Consistent font size for titles
     - [ ] Consistent font size throughout (accessibility guidance suggests using Font 18 as the *smallest* font used
     - [ ] Minimize italics and underlining
     - [ ] Alt-text for graphics ([learn more](https://www.perkins.org/resource/how-create-accessible-powerpoints/))
     - [ ] Clear labeling of graphics (include axis titles, keys etc)
     - [ ] Slide numbering
     - [ ] Credit/cite graphics, images and data which is not yours (hyperlink if slides are getting distributed) 
     - [ ] Insert long descriptions for complex graphics, where appropriate
- [ ] Other things to consider
     - [ ] Logos on each page (usually in the top left or right)
     - [ ] Disclaimers (usually in the footer)
     - [ ] Don't use words when an image will do
     - [ ] Less words is better, but don't cut down words to the extent that those using a screen-reader will be unable to understand the presentation 
     - [ ] Avoid excess animation
     - [ ] Use an accessibility checker ([how to](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/make-your-powerpoint-presentations-accessible-to-people-with-disabilities-6f7772b2-2f33-4bd2-8ca7-dae3b2b3ef25) for PowerPoint, [chrome extension](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/accessibility_checker_for_slides/437536886016) for Google Slides)
     - [ ] If pre-recording the video, be sure to add captions
     - [ ] If handing out slides, avoid using the "notes" area to convey important information. Further, "handout" slides will necessarily be wordier than slides that are being presented or shared with an accompanying video/voice track 
- [ ] Final Tips!
     - [ ] Practice your talk with and without your slides - you never know when the video/presentation equipment might fail!
     - [ ] Show your slides to someone who hasn't heard your talk and doesn't know your research - is your information clear to a novice? 
     - [ ] If someone else is driving your slides, practice asking for "next slide" so that it doesn't catch you off-guard 
     - [ ] If you are driving your slides, practice clicking through in presentation mode 
     - [ ] Run spell-check and read for typos 
     - [ ] Date your slides, particularly if this is on-going research, so that it is clear what stage of the work is being shared! 
     - [ ] Include a link to where audience members can get more information. We recommend creating a QR code if doing this live, so that audience members can scan it and go to your page
