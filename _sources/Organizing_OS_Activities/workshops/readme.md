# Organizing a Workshop

*Workshops that teach about open science can be organized everywhere! Are you attending a conference and want to organize a TOPS workshop? We can help!*

Here is all you need for a self-organized workshop. 

TOPS welcomes you to organize and run your own workshop. Please connect with any of our trained instructors(TBD) who can teach the workshop. First, please notify us that you intend to organize a workshop by registering your workshop here(TBD). Most workshops will teach one or more modules from OpenCore.

Get started with our [workshop checklist](./workshop_checklist.md). Thank you to the Carpentries and their [workshops](https://carpentries.org/workshops/) for getting us started! 

## What are the requirements for a TOPS workshop?

A TOPS workshop must meet the following requirements:

- Have at least one certified instructor. Suggested certification courses can be found at:
     - [Carpentries Instructor Training](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/), particularly their [Examples and Practical Guidance](https://open-science-training-handbook.gitbook.io/book/examples-and-practical-guidance)
     - [Open Science Training Handbook](https://open-science-training-handbook.gitbook.io/book/on-learning-and-training)
     - [Complexity Explorer Introduction to Open science](https://www.complexityexplorer.org/courses/125-introduction-to-open-science)
     - [Train the Trainer Seminar](https://youtu.be/RbeY0dXER6g), which is not specific to open science but provides guidance for how to lead a training 
- Must use The TOPS [OpenCore](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/blob/main/docs/Area2_Capacity_Sharing/OpenCore/readme.md) or [ScienceCore](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/blob/main/docs/Area2_Capacity_Sharing/ScienceCore/readme.md) curriculum
- Use the TOPS surveys to help us evaluate the curriculum content. Contact us [using this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1XcjQU9vYyXAMmJFdB6H021PFypGYWbNKvNR_em5q2UY/edit) to get the latest survey.
