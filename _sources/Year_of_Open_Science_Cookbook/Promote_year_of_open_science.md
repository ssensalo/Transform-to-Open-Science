# Promote the Year of Open Science
*Individuals and organizations at the start of their open science journey can be a part of NASA's Year of Open Science by promoting the Year of Open Science!*

## Contribute to TOPS Open Science Success Stories

**What is it?**

At conferences, during webinars and community forums, and via one-on-one conversation, TOPS is collecting stories about projects and people who have demonstrated the success of open science practices. Examples of these Open Science Success Stories can be found on [science.nasa.gov](https://science.nasa.gov/open-science/transform-to-open-science/stories) and on the [TOPS GitHub](/README.md). 

**How do I get started?**

Collect open science stories about your organization, highlighting how open science makes research teams more diverse and inclusive, and research more accessible, transparent, reproducible and replicable. You can either post these stories on your organization’s blog, webpage or podcast, or contribute to TOPS open science story project.   

**Basic Requirements**

In order to create a TOPS Open Science Story, the following elements should be included in the blog or interview:
* The interviewee’s personal definition of open science, and how it connects to [NASA’s definition](/docs/Area4_Moving_To_Openness/Open_Science.md) 
* A description of at least one, distinct research project or scientific initiative which demonstrates open science principles or practices. 
* Information or stories about the challenges or barriers faced when first embarking on the open science project, as well as the ultimate benefits of preserving, to help encourage others to also adopt open science. 
* If possible, post this story with a CC-BY license and share it on Zenodo or some other persistent identifier site, to facilitate sharing.
* Tweet it out! Use social media, listservs, your organization’s news page or other methods to share this story with your community.  

**TOPS Will Provide**

TOPS will provide organizations with the following support:
* Year of Open Science branding packet, including templates for stickers, presentation templates, Zoom backgrounds, and a guide for the use of NASA’s and TOPS’ logo and name
* TOPS can also provide the list of questions used when writing the initial Open Science Stories at [https://science.nasa.gov/open-science/transform-to-open-science/stories](https://science.nasa.gov/open-science/transform-to-open-science/stories) 


## Encourage Participation in the TOPS Open Science Curriculum

**What is it?**

Whether someone is looking to transition to a new way of conducting research or just getting started in their scientific career, TOPS aims to meet everyone where they are at on their open science journey. As such, one of TOPS' priorities is to develop and launch an open science curriculum that includes important definitions, tools, resources and best practices. You can learn more about the TOPS curriculum on our GitHub in [Area2_Capacity_Sharing](/docs/Area2_Capacity_Sharing/readme.md). 

A “fast-pass” option will be available for those who are already well-versed in open science, and current open science practitioners will be able to complete activities in order to earn the final TOPS open science badge. For those who prefer to go through the full course, micro-badges will be available at every module and the TOPS open science badge will be awarded at the end. (Why badging? Learn more at [Micro-Badging Details on the TOPS GitHub.](/docs/Area3_Incentives/micro-badging_details.md)) 

**How do I get started?**

Join the [TOPS email list](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeb_6PdbaPYFcVwXWgMJ053Q_pF2rW2YOu51Qmrh5nWaRYc7Q/viewform) to get announcements, including the dates when the first version of the core open science curriculum, the OpenCore, is released. Once available, share the OpenCore with your organization and encourage participation via newsletters, announcement boards, tweets, emails or whichever communication method you prefer. 

**Basic Requirements**

When encouraging folks at your organization to participate in the TOPS Open Science curriculum, be sure to mention:
* TOPS’ goal to train 20,000 scientists, 
* The fast-pass option for those already familiar with open science, and 
* The badging structure. 

**TOPS Will Provide**

To help make this effort a success, TOPS will provide organizations with the following support:
* The TOPS open science curriculum (coming soon!). 
* A list of open science resources to get started, while the curriculum is under development ([start here](/docs/Area2_Capacity_Sharing/OpenCore/open_science_ethos_module.md)).  
    * More information available in the materials from the [August community forum](/docs/Area1_Engagement/Community_Forums/2022_Forums/20220811_community_forum.md). 
* Year of Open Science branding packet, including templates for stickers, presentation templates, Zoom backgrounds, and a guide for the use of NASA’s and TOPS’ logo and name


## Encourage Your Community to join the TOPS Open Meetings

**What is it?**

Every month, TOPS has an open meeting to share updates on TOPS events, progress against our goals, and resources for conducting open science. During these community forums, TOPS can directly receive feedback from the community in the form of interactive tools, web-chat, and breakout rooms. Information from our past community forums to-date can be found on our GitHub in the [Community Forums](/docs/Area1_Engagement/Community_Forums/readme.md) directory. 

**How do I get started?**

Sign up for the [TOPS email list](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeb_6PdbaPYFcVwXWgMJ053Q_pF2rW2YOu51Qmrh5nWaRYc7Q/viewform) to get information on each month’s topic, and sign-up for the next event. 

**Basic Requirements**

When encouraging folks at your organization to join us at the next TOPS community forum, be sure to mention:
* TOPS’ mission goals and areas of action, a summary of which is [here](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science#what-we-do), and 
* To join the listserv ([here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeb_6PdbaPYFcVwXWgMJ053Q_pF2rW2YOu51Qmrh5nWaRYc7Q/viewform)).

**TOPS Will Provide**

To help make this effort a success, TOPS will provide organizations with the following support:
* Materials from each community forum, which can be found on our GitHub in the [Community Forums](/docs/Area1_Engagement/Community_Forums/readme.md) directory. 
* Year of Open Science branding packet, including templates for stickers, presentation templates, Zoom backgrounds, and a guide for the use of NASA’s and TOPS’ logo and name.
