# Strengthening the Year of Open Science

*If you are an open science practitioner or part of an organization committed to reflecting open science principles in your policy, funding, and governance, then TOPS invites you to join us in strengthening open science through your participation in the Year of Open science.*


## Budget for Year of Open Science Activities

**What is it?**

The Year of Open Science will activate our communities, encouraging everyone to adopt and champion open science practices. TOPS invites all organizations to join us on the Year of Open Science, and suggests that organizations set aside a budget for targeted activities best suited to transform the culture in your organization. 

**How do I get started?**

This collaboration guide has examples of several Year of Open Science activities, including hackathons, open science training, webinars, listening sessions, and town halls. The employees of your organization may be more motivated to participate in these if they are compensated for their time; and some of the activities require funding for the resources necessary to complete them. Decide on the Year of Open Science strategy that works for you, and consider if pre-existing budgets–for example, for training–can be utilized. 

**TOPS Will Provide**

To help make this event a success, TOPS will provide organizations with the following support:
* Year of Open Science branding packet, including templates for stickers, presentation templates, Zoom backgrounds, and a guide for the use of NASA’s and TOPS’ logo and name

## Contribute to the ScienceCore

**What is it?**

Whether someone is looking to transition to a new way of conducting research or just getting started in their scientific career, TOPS aims to meet everyone where they are at on their open science journey. The core TOPS open science curriculum, [the OpenCore](/docs/Area2_Capacity_Sharing/OpenCore/readme.md), will provide beginners with important definitions, tools, resources and best practices. 

To help scientists and researchers deepen their knowledge of open science practices in a particular field, gain advanced skills in data science or other research-enabling practices, and gain a more nuanced understanding of open science principles, TOPS aims to create the [ScienceCore](/docs/Area2_Capacity_Sharing/ScienceCore/readme.md). 

**How do I get started?**

TOPS has released a ROSES seeking contributors to the ScienceCore.

## Develop Governance Frameworks and Policies to Support Open Science Action Plans

**What is it?**

There are several cultural and institutional barriers which have prevented the adoption of open science in the past. Some of these are born from the academic incentive system, while others are reinforced by the desire to capitalize research. Organizations with clear policies that support the sharing of resources, data, code, and results such that they can be utilized by others encourage the adoption of open science. 

**How do I get started?**

The US federal government has [taken steps ](/docs/Area4_Moving_To_Openness/Open_Timeline.md)towards mandating the open sharing of publications and data produced by US government funding. Additionally, there are several [global policies](/docs/Area4_Moving_To_Openness/global_policies.md) supporting the move to open science. Organizations should begin by examining their own publication and data management policies and frameworks to ensure that they complement these. In some cases, organizations may need to provide greater detail or guidance than what exists in federal documents, to account for the needs and practices of a particular community or scientific field.

**Basic Requirements**

To develop policies which truly advance open science, we recommend the following:
* In addition to examining the relevant [US Federal guidance](/docs/Area4_Moving_To_Openness/Open_Timeline.md) and [global guidance](/docs/Area4_Moving_To_Openness/global_policies.md), organizations should examine the practices of the most popular journals or publication venues for the researchers of their organization. Any conflicting guidance should be noted, and addressed in the frameworks created for your organization. 
* The TOPS definition of open science includes opening data, software, results and methods; in addition to committing to principles of transparency, accessibility, inclusivity and reproducibility. Consider committing to a definition of open science at your organization, and build policies and frameworks that support it. 
* Be sure to include your organization’s researchers and scientists in the process of creating new policies; hold listening sessions, town halls, or office hours in which those most affected by these policies can provide feedback, and perhaps reveal barriers to their adoption. 

**TOPS Will Provide**

To help make this event a success, TOPS will provide organizations with the following support:
* A list of open science resources to get started, while the curriculum is under development, and the TOPS open science curriculum itself (once released). Current information on the TOPS open science curriculum, which can be found on the GitHub in [Area2_Capacity_Sharing](/docs/Area2_Capacity_Sharing/readme.md). 
* Year of Open Science branding packet, including templates for stickers, presentation templates, Zoom backgrounds, and a guide for the use of NASA’s and TOPS’ logo and name


## Host a Hackathon 

**What is it?**

Hackathons have become popular in recent years as a mechanism for getting software developers, engineers, researchers and scientists together to think up out-of-the-box solutions for interesting or difficult problems. In addition to working on the problems at hand, hackathon participants often attend workshops or presentations, create a final poster or presentation, and have an opportunity to mingle with sponsors or leaders. We suggest hosting a hackathon with an open science theme! Use either NASA or your own organization’s open data to tackle a new problem; or challenge participants to think of a new way to overcome a barrier to adopting open science! 

**How do I get started?**

There are several resources available for organizations who have not hosted hackathons in the past. At minimum, you will need a team that will act as the hackathon coordinators, and can arrange the (physical or virtual) venue, advertise the event, help participants sign-up and choose a team, find speakers, and arrange prizes. 

**Basic Requirements**

A hackathon with a Year of Open Science theme should, at minimum:
* Use open data when solving the presented challenges. 
* Post all code generated by the hackathon openly, with as unrestrictive a license as possible. 
* Collaborate on the hackathon as openly as possible, using open science frameworks such as [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/). 

**TOPS Will Provide**

To help make this event a success, TOPS will provide organizations with the following support:
* TOPS will amplify your event on our listserv, via Twitter, and in our community forums.
* A directory of NASA’s open data and open resources to search and use them. More information available on the pages of the [Open-Source Science Initiative](https://science.nasa.gov/open-science-overview) (OSSI).
* Year of Open Science branding packet, including templates for stickers, presentation templates, Zoom backgrounds, and a guide for the use of NASA’s and TOPS’ logo and name


## Host a Webinar on Using Your Organization’s Open Data or Open Software

**What is it?**

Does your organization have data, software, or publications which are freely available or only require a free login to access? Are members of your organizations aware of these resources? Are people not affiliated with your organization aware of these resources? To boost the usage of the open data, open-source software, or other open scientific information of which your organization is a steward, we recommend hosting a virtual webinar or town hall on how to use that information! 

**How do I get started?**

Prior to scheduling the session, make sure to gather any instructions related to accessing, downloading, and properly citing the data or software. If possible, plan a demo related to an open science project for the webinar, and focus on best practices for using your organization’s data or software. Be sure to record and create a transcript of the session, and upload them to your organization’s website along with any access instructions. 

**Basic Requirements**

To help make this event a success, we recommend the following:
* If your organization has open data, open-source software, a preprint or open access server, and free resources for scientific analysis we recommend *not* trying to cover them all in a single webinar. Instead, consider putting on a webinar series, with each event focusing on one type of scientific information. Similarly, if your organization has multiple types of data, with special access instructions for each type, consider splitting that webinar into a multi-part series, too. 
* Ensure that the instructions for accessing your organization’s open scientific information are easy to find. Clearly display any limitations to the usage of the data or software, and include instructions for citing the data and code of others. 
* If possible, include a demo of using the data, software etc. during the webinar, and use  that to highlight those in your organization already engaged in open science.
* Contact TOPS to amplify your event! We can send your event series to our listserv and amplify your Tweets.

**TOPS Will Provide**

To help make this event a success, TOPS will provide organizations with the following support:
* TOPS will amplify your event on our listserv, via Twitter, and in our community forums.

## Host a Summer School on Open Science

**What is it?**

Science team summer schools are five-day workshops, hosted by various partner and collaborator organizations in the months of June, July and August. During these weeks, members of a science team dive deeply into a particular topic, allowing time for training, discussion and ideation. 

**How do I get started?**

More information on TOPS open science summer schools is contained in ROSES [F.14 Transform to Open Science Training](https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary.do?solId=%7bAB776446-03A8-4C24-845D-2E5A2ADA2D5A%7d&path=&method=init), in Section 3.2.

## Run an OpenCore Virtual Cohort

**What is it?**

Whether someone is looking to transition to a new way of conducting research or just getting started in their scientific career, TOPS aims to meet everyone where they are at on their open science journey. As such, one of TOPS' priorities is to develop and launch an open science curriculum that includes important definitions, tools, resources and best practices. You can learn more about the TOPS curriculum on our GitHub in [Area2_Capacity_Sharing](/docs/Area2_Capacity_Sharing/readme.md). 

TOPS is seeking solicitations for organizations who will organize and run “virtual cohorts” of learners to take the TOPS core open science curriculum (OpenCore).    

**How do I get started?**

More information on TOPS OpenCore virtual cohorts is contained in ROSES [F.14 Transform to Open Science Training](https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary.do?solId=%7bAB776446-03A8-4C24-845D-2E5A2ADA2D5A%7d&path=&method=init), in Section 3.2.

## Sponsor an Award

**What is it?**

Your organization has researchers and scientists who have been practicing open science, perhaps even without knowing they were doing so! Similarly, one of the greatest barriers to the wide-spread adoption of open science is the worry that a large amount of time will be sunk into open science activities—pre-registering studies, releasing pre-prints, documenting code or assigning meta-data—and that the work will ultimately not be recognized. To encourage individuals to adopt additional open science practices, and to reward those who have already been practicing open science, we recommend creating open science awards!    

**How do I get started?**

Although the word “awards'' conjures images of a Nobel prize or an Oscar, smaller awards that are specific to your organization are just as valuable for your community. Consider the culture of your organization and how you recognize leaders, innovators, and trail blazers. Can you create an award recognizing open science practices in action that can be presented at an all-hands? If your organization funds research, consider an award that recognizes open science practices in work conducted using your funding. If your organization has a yearly conference or workshop, consider honoring those who conduct open science at those events!   

**Basic Requirements**

We suggest the following considerations when creating an open science award: 
* The award should consider whether the person, team or project being recognized is transparent, accessible, inclusive and reproducible.
* The award must consider individuals and teams with a diversity of experience, including diversity with respect to race, gender, geography, country of citizenship, academic background, profession, and areas of expertise.
* The award should recognize at least one aspect of open science practice, this could include, but is not be limited to:
    * Use and inclusion of open-source software, code sharing practices, and open-source repositories and tools;
    * Use and inclusion of data sharing, data repositories, curation, and/or creation of open data;
    * Use and inclusion of with open-access publishing, pre-publication, peer review, academic review and/or tenure processes, replication and reproducibility in scientific results, and virtual research environments;
    * Participation or leadership in open science communities;
    * Participation or leadership in diverse communities dedicated to advancing diversity in STEM, diversity in academia; and,
    * Participation or leadership in community organizing around equity and inclusion in STEM, climate justice, or citizen science.
* Open science is reliant upon teamwork, and recognizes that the different experiences we bring to the table strengthens a project. Consider creating a team award, rather than one that implies individual merit.

## Sponsor a Grand Challenge

**What is it?**

To solve the biggest challenges faced in our world today–such as climate change, extreme weather, endemic COVID-19–we need everyone, from all walks of life and with all academic experiences. The sharing of data, results, code, and policy during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the impact and effectiveness of openly sharing research. What other grand challenges could we solve if we were dedicated to solving them using principles of open science? 

**How do I get started?**

What is the biggest challenge that your organization is poised to tackle? Consider how open science could help solve that problem. Work with NASA to determine if our data, software or resources could help! 

**TOPS Will Provide**

To help make this event a success, TOPS will provide organizations with the following support:
* Year of Open Science branding packet, including templates for stickers, presentation templates, Zoom backgrounds, and a guide for the use of NASA’s and TOPS’ logo and name
