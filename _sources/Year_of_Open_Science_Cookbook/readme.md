<h1>How to Participate in NASA’s Year of Open Science</h1>
<i>The Transform to Open Science (TOPS) mission is designed to rapidly transform agencies, organizations, and communities to an inclusive culture of open science.</i>

<h2>Open Science</h2>
Open science—opening up the scientific process from idea inception to result—increases access to knowledge and expands opportunities for participation. Sharing the data, code, results, and knowledge associated with the scientific process enables more inclusive, diverse and equitable participation in science, while also leading to more transparent, replicable and reproducible results. But achieving this openness requires changing how we work, to help us move forward together.

<h2>NASA’s Transform to Open Science mission</h2>
To help catalyze the move to open science and support changing cultural norms, NASA is championing the Transform to Open Science (TOPS) mission and has declared 2023 as the Year Of Open Science. TOPS  is a $40 million, 5-year NASA Science Mission Directorate mission geared towards accelerating the adoption and understanding of open science. TOPS will focus on four areas of action—engagement, capacity sharing, incentives, and moving towards openness—to make progress against three goals:
<ol>
    <li> To accelerate major scientific discoveries
    <li> To increase understanding and adoption of open science
    <li> To broaden participation by historically underrepresented communities
</ol>
These areas are designed to increase awareness about open science, provide learning resources for those looking to deepen their understanding and usage of open science practices and principles, and to promote events that support transitioning to open science. By partnering and collaborating with other organizations, NASA will support and enable the scientific community to move towards open science. 

<h4> The success of the Year of Open Science will be driven by the enthusiasm and level of engagement of partnering organizations, who can undertake any number of the discrete tasks listed below to promote, engage with, and strengthen the Year of Open Science! </h4>

    <b>For You:</b> Are you just beginning your open science journey? Perhaps you have only just begun to post your code or data online, share your pre-prints, or share your null hypothesis as part of your grant application? Or perhaps you are exploring science communication on a personal blog, or are taking a critical look at the diversity in your lab or research group and actively imagining how to make it more inclusive. All of these behaviors exemplify open science and we would like for you to join us in the Year of Open Science! If you are excited to learn and encourage others to learn about open science as part of the Year of Open Science, then we invite you to explore how to <a href="https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/blob/main/Year_of_Open_Science_Cookbook/Promote_year_of_open_science.md">Promote the Year of Open Science</a>!<br>
    <br>
    <b>For Your Organization:</b> Is your organization interested in adopting open science principles and practices, but unsure of how to begin? The Year of Open Science promotion activities could help you reflect together on how to equip the people at your organization with practical knowledge in open science, as well as introduce them to a wider community of open science practitioners.

  <summary><h3>Engage</h3></summary>
    <b>For You:</b> Are you familiar with open science practices and excited to learn more, and bring others on the journey with you? Perhaps you have attended hackathons and open science workshops in the past, assist others with metadata or the documentation of their code, or get excited when you see funding opportunities that involve data-sharing. You are already fully engaged in the open science community and we invite you to join us, and <a href="https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/blob/main/Year_of_Open_Science_Cookbook/Engage_year_of_open_science.md">Engage with the Year of Open Science</a>!<br>
    <br>
    <b>For Your Organization:</b> Has your organization begun to adopt open science principles and practices? Perhaps your organization encourages pre-prints, requires the sharing of research code online, or maintains an archive for all organizational data. The Year of Open Science engagement activities will deepen the interest of those in your organization in practicing open science, perhaps highlighting new ways of being involved, as an organization, in spreading open science practices throughout your scientific fields.
