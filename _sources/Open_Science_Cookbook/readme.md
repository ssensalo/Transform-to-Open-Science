# Open Science Cookbook

The Open Science Cookbook is your guide to how to get started with open science!

## What is Open Science?
Open science—opening up the scientific process from idea inception to result—increases access to knowledge and expands opportunities for participation. Sharing the data, code, results, and knowledge associated with the scientific process enables more inclusive, diverse and equitable participation in science, while also leading to more transparent, replicable and reproducible results. But achieving this openness requires changing how we work, to help us move forward together.

## NASA’s Transform to Open Science mission
To help catalyze the move to open science and support changing cultural norms, NASA is championing the Transform to Open Science (TOPS) mission and has declared 2023 as the Year of Open Science. TOPS  is a $40 million, 5-year NASA Science Mission Directorate mission geared towards accelerating the adoption and understanding of open science. TOPS will focus on four areas of action—engagement, capacity sharing, incentives, and moving towards opennessto make progress against three goals:
- To accelerate major scientific discoveries
- To increase understanding and adoption of open science
- To broaden participation by historically underrepresented communities

These areas are designed to increase awareness about open science, provide learning resources for those looking to deepen their understanding and usage of open science practices and principles, and to promote events that support transitioning to open science. By partnering and collaborating with other organizations, NASA will support and enable the scientific community to move towards open science. 

## Your Open Science Journey
Research labs, scientific funding organizations, and individual researchers have known and discussed for many years how interdisciplinary and diverse teams are capable of advancing scientific progress. These groups and individuals began to advocate for inclusive labs and organizations, where data and scientific practice was equitable and accessible to people from different backgrounds, with differing levels of academic training, and with different lived experiences. Although they may not have called this movement toward diverse and accessible research "open science," these same principles of equity and inclusivity are core to the open science ethos.

Other researchers and organizations have come to advocate for open science through their experiences trying to access data, code, research methods, and publications through the course of their own scientific practice or funding apparatus. Frustration with embargo periods, incomplete or unsorted data sets, non-replicable results, or code that is anything but user-friendly have all resulted in a movement for full transparency of research, from the idea inception through the pre-registration of studies to the final results via open-source code, public data-sets, and open-access publications.

If you or your organization are involved with anything that has been mentioned above--diverse and inclusive labs and research teams, equitable funding of science, accessible and human-readable data, freely available methodology and results--or any of the other, myriad ways that scientific practice is moving towards openness; then welcome! You are already on your open science journey. Jump ahead to the sections on **Engage** and **Strengthen** to join TOPS in transforming research culture towards open science.

If the vision painted above sounds like something you want to become involved with, but you do not know how to begin, read on! The resources in **Promote** will invite you to identify how you can join us on the journey towards open science. 


 ### Promote

Are you just beginning your open science journey? Perhaps you have only just begun to post your code or data online, share your pre-prints, or share your null hypothesis as part of your grant application? Or perhaps you are exploring science communication on a personal blog, or are taking a critical look at the diversity in your lab or research group and actively imagining how to make it more inclusive. Or perhaps all of this is new to you, and you are looking for a guidebook to put you on the right track. Navigate to the [Promote Open Science](./Promote_open_science.md) cookbook!

### Engage

Are you familiar with open science practices and excited to learn more, and bring others on the journey with you? Perhaps you have attended hackathons and open science workshops in the past, assist others with metadata or the documentation of their code, or get excited when you see funding opportunities that involve data-sharing. Is your organization ready to tackle how to insert open science into its policy and governance models? You are already fully engaged in the open science community and we invite you to join us, and [Engage with Open Science!](./Engage_open_science.md)

### Strengthen

You are an active and involved member of the open science community. You get excited when funders require that research be conducted openly, and find small ways of teaching others about open science whenever you speak to others about your research. You are ready to be an advocate for moving towards open science within your organization. We need you to help us strengthen open science in your community and beyond. Our suggestions for how to do so are in [Strengthen Open Science Cookbook](./Strengthen_open_science.md).

### Conferences:
Does your organization host a conference? Navigate straight to our [Year of Open Science Conferences](/Year_of_Open_Science_Cookbook/conferences_for_the_year_of_open_science.md) cookbook to learn more about how TOPS wishes to work with you.

### Read These Open Science Resources:
TOPS is collecting a living list of open science resources! We have divided them into two documents to make it a bit easier to find what you need
           
- The [reading list](./reading_list.md) contains information about existing open science trainings, guides for data science, and a list of open science publications referenced when creating the TOPS open science curriculum 
- The [coding resources](./code_learning_resources.md) contains suggestions for documenting scientific software as well as getting started with coding. Ready to get a bit more granular? Here is a suggested checklist for open-source code [documentation](./software_citation_checklist.md).
