# Software Citation Checklist

Plan, curate, and connect your software. Use this checklist to improve your  software citation, discovery and credit. 

## Your Software Management Plan

- [ ] **Decide on and use an open-source license.** Use the [choose an open-source license](https://choosealicense.com/) site to decide. If you were funded to write the software, the agency or organization may have an information policy or software release policy that specifies a certain type of license (e.g., NASA specifies using a permissive license).

- [ ] **Documentation is key.** Plan to capture information that will be vital to describing and citing your  software later including authors (contributors), project/software name, releases (versions), coding standards, dependencies, frameworks, tests, and sustainability. See SSI’s [Software Management Plans](https://www.software.ac.uk/software-management-plans). Note: Planning to share your software at the beginning of your project is easier than trying to reconstruct your work at the end!

## Your Software Management Platform

- [ ] **Choose a software version control platform.** There are several software development platforms that enable collaborative work, both in public and private repositories. These include GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, and more. These are not long-term preservation solutions because they are designed to evolve. Look ahead to when you will preserve and cite your software and identify a repository you will  use (domain, institutional, general).  

- [ ] **Determine what metadata you will need.** E.g. [Making your code citable](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/referencing-and-citing-content) via Zenodo and GitHub and  using [Zenodo’s Sandbox](https://sandbox.zenodo.org/) allows you to see additional metadata that you will need including ORCIDs for  authors, related identifiers (e.g. paper DOIs), funding information, etc. and the [CodeMeta file](https://codemeta.github.io/) that is  created.  

## Your Software Availability Statement and Citation

- [ ] **Include your Software Availability Statement.** Your Software Availability Statement might significant impact on your research and/or  your research is not reproducible without it. 

- [ ] Your **Software Availability Statement** should include: 
    - [ ] Very brief **description** of what the software is used for 
    - [ ] **Repository [DOI/PID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier)** for your preserved software (e.g. Zenodo)
    - [ ] **Version or release** of the software used and preserved 
    - [ ] (Open source) **license** and other **access conditions**
    - [ ] Development **platform link** (e.g., GitHub repository) 
- [ ] In the **methodology section** of your paper: 
    - [ ] Describe how your software works as it pertains to your research.
- [ ] Include the software in your **references** using the preserved software’s **repository DOI/PID** and include a **[Software]** bracketed description (See [AGU software citation examples](https://www.agu.org/Publish-with-AGU/Publish/Author-Resources/Data-and-Software-for-Authors#citation), format using [DOI Citation Formatter](https://citation.crosscite.org/)). If the software includes a paper, cite it as well, without the bracketed description. 

## Your Software Citation File Format

- [ ] **Add instructions to your development platform (e.g., GitHub) on how to cite your software**. Use the [Citation File Format](https://citation-file-format.github.io/).
