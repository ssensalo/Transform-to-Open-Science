**Is your team ready to embark on a journey towards open science?**

## Section 1: Engage With Open Science

### Explore the Open Science Toolkit of the National Academies 
We invite all our partners to read and adapt the recommendations from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine workshop in 2021, “Developing a Toolkit for Fostering Open Science Practices: Proceedings of a Workshop.” Which can be found at [https://doi.org/10.17226/26308](https://doi.org/10.17226/26308). 

In particular, the Toolkit Materials in Appendix C provide resources for:
* Drafting an institution statement of support for open science methods and practices (pages 33 to 45)
* Examples of successful and impactful open science work such as the Human Genome Project and the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (pages 36 to 39)
* A sample template and rubric for assessing a grant/job application for adherence to open science principles (pages 46 to 69)
* A series of short primers on various open-science topics (pages 70 to 92)

### Discuss Your Team's Data and Research Products
Open Science calls for researchers to strive to open their entire research life-cyle--from idea generation to final publications and code--so that others can build on their work. Research data should be as open as is possible without compromising personal identying information, national or personal security, or violating research ethics. 

This can seem like a daunting task, but any amount of openness, such as putting publications on an open-access server or using persistent digital identifiers, helps make data more accessible. Sit down with your team and discuss the following, and see if you are able to make some of your processes more open:
* Consider the data you use or generate: 
    * Where can researchers find your data? What is your process/method for releasing data? Can portions of it be anonymized such that it can be shared? Is the process for requesting access to your data clear? How fast is the data request process and how often do you go through the process of releasing data? Does your organization have practices around pre-registration and archiving? Are these practices well-known and front-of-mind?
    * [Registry of Research Data Repositories](https://www.re3data.org/) is an example site for finding open databases 
* If your team produces its own research, consider if:
    * Research plans may be made available, prior to the start of the project, 
    * That reproducibility/replicability studies be valued and encouraged, and
    * That null/negative results be published. 
    * Some examples of making research plans available can be found at [AsPredicted](https://aspredicted.org/), [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/), and [Registered Reports](https://cos.io/rr/) 
    * Examples of journals that publish negative/nul results include Positively Negative (PLOS One), The Missing Pieces: A Collection of Negative; Null and Inconclusive Results (PLOS One), The All Results Journals, ACS Omega (ACS Publications), F1000Research, PeerJ, Journal of Negative Results in Biomedicine, Journal of Negative Results: Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Journal of Articles in Support of the Null Hypothesis, Journal of Pharmaceutical Negative results and Nature Scientific Reports
    * Examples of journals that publish reproducibility/replicability studies are PLOS ONE, and [Royal Society](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/rsos/replication-studies)
* If your team produces its own research OR uses research created by others, consider: 
    * Do you require that the list of materials, study methods, and computational environment be included in the final results which are shared publicly? If not, consider making this a requirement of the project. 
* For data or research produced *by* your organization: 
    * In what languages is the research available? Are bilingual researchers encouraged to apply for funding? Or, better yet, publish in multiple languages? 
    * Consider adding extensions to your databases, publication sites, or other methods of sharing data to allow for easy translation into other languages. 
* Does your team develop software or other code artifacts/products? 
    * Can this code be made publicly available via GitHub, BitBucket or other mechanisms? 
    * Consider how much of the work of your group ought to be kept “closed” and how much can be made available to advance the work of others, particularly young professionals and early career researchers.

## Section 2: Team Collaborations with TOPS

### Highlight Your Team's Open Science Experts

**What is it?**

Consider your team's current open science practice: do researchers use or share open-source code, are pre-prints encouraged or required, is data added to a database or are studies pre-registered? Open science can take many forms, and each is valid. Highlight some of the open science experts on your team during your next meeting, and celebrate with those outside your group, too.   

**How do we get started?**

Depending on your team, there may already be a list of those who are freely sharing their research practices or results. Start with that list, and see if any researchers would be interested in speaking to the broader group about how they got started with open science. 

Other teams may need to spend some time brainstorming, ideally through a platform that allows for diverse participation, about ways in which scientists outside your team are embracing open science. That brainstorming exercise can serve the dual purpose of getting those team members who were unaware they were doing open science, or not practicing it as of yet, interested in the movement. 

Unsure whether your team is practicing open science or not? We recommend the following article to get started: Ummul-Kiram Kathawalla, Priya Silverstein, Moin Syed; Easing Into Open Science: A Guide for Graduate Students and Their Advisors. Collabra: Psychology 4 January 2021; 7 (1): 18684. doi: [https://doi.org/10.1525/collabra.18684](https://doi.org/10.1525/collabra.18684) 

**Basic Requirements**

When highlighting your team’s open science experts, you are doing more than just sharing a project that was done according to open science principles; you are also giving those just beginning their open science journey a model to follow. Therefore, to ensure the success of those up-and-coming researchers, we recommend the following be included in the blog, web-page, or meeting in which you highlight your team's open science:
* The elements of open science included in their work and research practices (including links to digital elements).
* Any challenges faced when adopting those open science practices, and how to overcome them. 
* Links to the open code, data, or publication archives of your organization. 
* Links to the publication, license, and/or copyright policies of your organization. 

You may also want to consider providing information on the data management plans and publication policies of any federal organizations who contribute to your team's funding. Links to many of those policies can be found on the TOPS GitHub at [Open Timeline](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/tree/main/docs/Area4_Moving_To_Openness/Open_Timeline.md). 

**TOPS Will Provide**

To help make this effort a success, TOPS will provide organizations with the following support:
* Resources on getting started with open science, which can be found in the open science curriculum pages at [Capacity Sharing: OpenCore](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/tree/main/docs/Area2_Capacity_Sharing/OpenCore/readme.md).
* Year of Open Science branding packet, including templates for stickers, presentation templates, Zoom backgrounds, and a guide for the use of NASA’s and TOPS’ logo and name


### Host a Listening Session

**What is it?**

A *listening session* is an open meeting in which the primary role of leaders is to listen to the feedback, ideas, critiques, and thoughts of the people in their organization. Often, listening sessions are moderated by someone with training in either mediation, conflict resolution, or transformative justice, to ensure that communication is honest, open, and respectful. Attendance is normally capped at twenty participants or less, to make sure that everyone who is present has a chance to speak. NPR has additional information on how to get started in their article “[Six ways to run a listening session](https://training.npr.org/2016/02/16/six-ways-to-run-a-listening-session/).”

An *open science listening session* either for your team (if it is larger than twenty people) or hosted by your team for you and your collaborators gives researchers and scientists an opportunity to express the ways in which they believe your team is actively advancing open science practices, and areas in which progress could be accelerated.         

**How do I get started?**

Depending on size of your team or the organization of which you are a part, you may have someone which specializes in moderation, running conferences or meetings, or provides anti-bias, diversity, or conflict-resolution training. Reach out to this group/person and ask them if they would be willing to host and moderate an open science listening session. Once the moderator has been identified, choose a date, time, and forum for the event. Virtual attendance may be easiest, particularly if the group is geographically diverse. Then advertise! 

Listening sessions work best when attendance is limited, to ensure that everyone who attends gets a voice at the table. Best practice is that attendance should be limited to twenty people. If more than twenty folks are interested, you may have to run several listening sessions to get the feedback necessary to generate change. 

If running a listening session will be too challenging (perhaps your organization is too large, or there is no one with training in moderation), a town hall format–in which there is someone sourcing questions but no active moderation, and a larger crowd in attendance–may be a bit easier.  

**Basic Requirements**

To help the listening session be successful, we recommend the following:
* Create an environment which is inclusive and respectful. 
    * If there will be twenty attendees, then maybe consider having only three or four organizational leaders present to hear the feedback. A note-take can be appointed, to bring the areas for improvement to a greater number of leaders. 
    * Choose (or create) a code of conduct prior to the meeting, and make sure everyone in attendance sees it ahead of time. Open the meeting by pointing to that code of conduct, and saying that anyone who violates it will be asked to leave. 
    * If one attendee is “dominating the airwaves,” the moderator should feel encouraged to reach out to them individually (perhaps via chat) to respectfully ask them to make space for the others in the room. 
* Send out conversation prompts ahead of the meeting, to give attendees time to consider their responses. People will appreciate having time to prepare. 

**TOPS Will Provide**

To help make this event a success, TOPS will provide organizations with the following support:
* Resources on getting started with open science, which can be found in the open science curriculum pages at [Capacity Sharing: OpenCore](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/tree/main/docs/Area2_Capacity_Sharing/OpenCore/readme.md).
* Year of Open Science branding packet, including templates for stickers, presentation templates, Zoom backgrounds, and a guide for the use of NASA’s and TOPS’ logo and name


### Provide Feedback on the TOPS Open Science Curriculum

**What is it?**

Whether someone is looking to transition to a new way of conducting research or just getting started in their scientific career, TOPS aims to meet everyone where they are at on their open science journey. As such, one of TOPS' priorities is to develop and launch an open science curriculum that includes important definitions, tools, resources and best practices. You can learn more about the TOPS curriculum on [our GitHub](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/tree/main/docs/Area2_Capacity_Sharing/readme.md). Grab a few team members and walk through our curriculum together, and let us know how we can improve.

**How do I get started?**

Join the [TOPS email list](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeb_6PdbaPYFcVwXWgMJ053Q_pF2rW2YOu51Qmrh5nWaRYc7Q/viewform) to get our announcements, including the dates when the first version of the core open science curriculum, the OpenCore, is made available for public comment. Once it is available, TOPS and its collaborators on the OpenCore, will need the scientific community to provide feedback on its content. More detailed instructions on the feedback process will be shared via the listserv soon. Organize a small group of both seasoned open science practitioners and those just getting started to test and provide feedback on the curriculum once it is available! 

**Basic Requirements**

When encouraging your team to participate as testers in the TOPS Open Science curriculum, be sure to mention:
* TOPS’ goal to train 20,000 scientists, 
* The fast-pass option for those already familiar with open science, and 
* The badging structure (Why badging? Learn more at [Micro-Badging Details on the TOPS GitHub](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/tree/main/docs/Area3_Incentives/micro-badging_details.md)). 

**TOPS Will Provide**

To help make this effort a success, TOPS will provide organizations with the following support:
* The open science curriculum for testing, once available, as well as instructions for how to provide feedback
* Additional information on the TOPS open science curriculum, which can be found on [the GitHub](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/tree/main/docs/Area2_Capacity_Sharing/readme.md) and in the information from the [August community forum](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/tree/main/docs/Area1_Engagement/Community_Forums/2022_Forums/20220811_community_forum.md). 
* Year of Open Science branding packet, including templates for stickers, presentation templates, Zoom backgrounds, and a guide for the use of NASA’s and TOPS’ logo and name


### Set a TOPS Open Science Badge Goal

**What is it?**

To complement its [open science curriculum](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/tree/main/docs/Area2_Capacity_Sharing/readme.md), TOPS is creating a series of TOPS digital micro-badges, which can be earned by either completing open science activities or the modules of the TOPS open science curriculum. Participants who complete all five modules will also earn the TOPS open science badge. Additional, supporting information on the TOPS badging program can be found on our GitHub, in [Micro-Badging Details](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/tree/main/docs/Area3_Incentives/micro-badging_details.md).

Teams can encourage one another to support the Year of Open Science by setting a team “badging goal,” and conduct a targeted communications campaign to reach that goal by the end of 2023.    

**How do I get started?**

Some teams may need to begin by consulting the learning and development groups and/or training teams within their larger organization, to verify the inclusion of pre-existing open science courses in the training packages available to employees and researchers. If there are open science topics (e.g., pre-registration, open access, open-source software readability guidelines), a directory of these courses should be assembled, with the open science topic they cover clearly identified. Any information that is available on the number of people who have completed these courses in the past few years should be collected. This information can be used as a reasonable starting point for the badging goal, as anyone who has received training in these topics will be able to complete the “fast-pass” activity to earn a micro-badge, without taking the entire module. 

For stand-alone teams or smaller organizations you might instead look at metrics such as the number of early career researchers on the team, or the number of publications submitted in a year which includes elements of open-source code or relies on public data sets. Any of these factors can be used to set the badging goal. 

**Basic Requirements**

When setting a TOPS open science badge goal for your organization, we recommend the following:
* Let us know so that TOPS can highlight your participation in our own communications. 
* Set up a learning cohort! 
    * Using Slack, MS Teams or other messaging and collaboration tools to help those taking the open science course connect with one another. This may help people identify new collaborators and expose those new to open science to how it is practiced in your organization. 
    * Set aside a particular week (or two) during which many people are encouraged to take the open science curriculum, together. Set up hour-long meet-ups each day during which folks can get together to discuss the topics of each module. 
* Identify a secondary incentive which is unique to your organization! TOPS is providing the digital badge, but maybe your organization/team is known for a different incentive structure. Could the first 10 researchers to earn the grand badge get a coffee mug or some other organizational SWAG? Be creative, and talk to our team about co-branding. 
* Encourage your organization’s leadership to participate in the TOPS badging program. The TOPS digital badges can be shared on social media, LinkedIn profiles, and added to digital signatures in emails. Have your leaders “tweet it out” when they complete their favorite module, and highlight this in organization communications. (Let us know about it, and TOPS will retweet!)
