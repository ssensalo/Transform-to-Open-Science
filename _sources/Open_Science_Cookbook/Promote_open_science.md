# Promote Open Science
*How to get started with open science and involved with TOPS.* 

## For the Individual Contributor
My research team, lab or organization is not ready for open science but I want to adopt open science principles. How do I get started? 

### Join the TOPS Community Forums

The TOPS community forums are monthly exchanges of about an hour in length which are open to the public. Anyone who has joined the TOPS [listserv](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeb_6PdbaPYFcVwXWgMJ053Q_pF2rW2YOu51Qmrh5nWaRYc7Q/viewform) receives an invitation to register for upcoming forums. Forum recordings and slides and posted in the [TOPS GitHub](/docs/Area1_Engagement/Community_Forums/readme.md). In cases where recordings are not taken, transcriptions will be made available, if possible.

The purpose of the Community Forums is to invite members of the community to become aware of and engage in conversation about upcoming events and recent progress on TOPS initiatives directly from the TOPS team. Further, these events can be leveraged to collect feedback from the community on TOPS core areas and activities, such as the OpenCore, the Year of Open Science, and upcoming conference presentations etc. The community forum will also likely be leveraged for specific topics in the future, such as a “workshop” on responding to ROSES or an introduction to SMD-specific open science policy. 

The TOPS team is committed to making these events as accessible as possible, and try to achieve this in the following manner:
* Holding the forum virtually 
* Providing transcription both during and after the meeting 
* Providing recordings
* Adding alt-text to images and slides

To encourage participation, the TOPS team leverages tools such as Jamboard, Mentimeter, and the chat during meetings. Participants are also encouraged to send in questions prior to the meeting, as well as utilize the chat during the event. Although the community forum events allow the community to see members of the TOPS Core team speak, it is scheduled during the weekday and during work hours, which limits who can attend. Furthermore, these events only occur monthly, requiring some other avenue of communication to be leveraged to preserve community engagement throughout the month. 
           
### Read These Open Science Resources
TOPS is collecting a living list of open science resources! We have divided them into two documents to make it a bit easier to find what you need
           
- The [reading list](./reading_list.md) contains information about existing open science trainings, guides for data science, and a list of open science publications referenced when creating the TOPS open science curriculum 
- The [coding resources](./code_learning_resources.md) contains suggestions for documenting scientific software as well as getting started with coding. Ready to get a bit more granular? Here is a suggested checklist for open-source code [documentation](./software_citation_checklist.md).           

### Join an Open Science Community
- [Pangeo](https://pangeo.io/) - an open science community with a weekly community meeting that starts with a 15 min science talk. Meeting schedule is at the bottom of [this](https://pangeo.io/meeting-notes.html) page.
     - Related, is the Pangeo-Forge data sharing roadmap: https://github.com/pangeo-forge/roadmap.
- [Openscapes](https://www.openscapes.org/) - an open source community offering mentorship, teaching, coaching and community organizing centered around open data science
- [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) - a great fun way to first get involved in open source software at any level. 
- The [Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA)](https://sfdora.org/) which recognizes the need to improve the ways in which researchers and the outputs of scholarly research are evaluated              

### Check-out What the Community is Saying
- [Medium](https://medium.com/) - People post a lot of tutorials, news about new developments in data management, cloud, it is a great space to learn.
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/home) - Follow scientists/data/organizations and get a daily feed of all the latest developments in open science (eg. [OpenSci_News](https://twitter.com/OpenSci_News) #openscience #openaccess #opendata
- [Pangeo Discourse](https://discourse.pangeo.io/)
- [TOPS Discussions](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/discussions)
           
## For the Organization

If you represent an organization interested in integrating open science principles and practices into your organization, we invite you to begin with the list of ideas presented in the [Promote the Year of Open Science Cookbook](/Year_of_Open_Science_Cookbook/Promote_year_of_open_science.md).
