# Guide for Your Open Science Journey

Are you just beginning your open science journey? Perhaps you have only just begun to post your code or data online, share your pre-prints, or share your null hypothesis as part of your grant application? Or perhaps you are exploring science communication on a personal blog, or are taking a critical look at the diversity in your lab or research group and actively imagining how to make it more inclusive. Or perhaps all of this is new to you! **Section 1: Engage With Open Science** will set you on the right path. 

Or are you familiar with open science practices and excited to learn more, and bring others on the journey with you? We invite you to join TOPS on our journey! Jump ahead to **Section 2: Collaborate With TOPS** to get the most out of this guide.

**Are you ready to begin your journey towards open science?** 

## Section 1: Engage With Open Science

### Join the TOPS Community Forums

The TOPS community forums are monthly exchanges of about an hour in length which are open to the public. Anyone who has joined the TOPS [listserv](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeb_6PdbaPYFcVwXWgMJ053Q_pF2rW2YOu51Qmrh5nWaRYc7Q/viewform) receives an invitation to register for upcoming forums. Forum recordings and slides and posted in the [TOPS GitHub](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/blob/main/docs/Area1_Engagement/Community_Forums/readme.md). In cases where recordings are not taken, transcriptions will be made available, if possible.

The purpose of the Community Forums is to invite members of the community to become aware of and engage in conversation about upcoming events and recent progress on TOPS initiatives directly from the TOPS team. Further, these events can be leveraged to collect feedback from the community on TOPS core areas and activities, such as the OpenCore, the Year of Open Science, and upcoming conference presentations etc. The community forum will also likely be leveraged for specific topics in the future, such as a “workshop” on responding to ROSES or an introduction to SMD-specific open science policy. 

The TOPS team is committed to making these events as accessible as possible, and try to achieve this in the following manner:
* Holding the forum virtually 
* Providing transcription both during and after the meeting 
* Providing recordings
* Adding alt-text to images and slides

To encourage participation, the TOPS team leverages tools such as Jamboard, Mentimeter, and the chat during meetings. Participants are also encouraged to send in questions prior to the meeting, as well as utilize the chat during the event. Although the community forum events allow the community to see members of the TOPS Core team speak, it is scheduled during the weekday and during work hours, which limits who can attend. Furthermore, these events only occur monthly, requiring some other avenue of communication to be leveraged to preserve community engagement throughout the month.

### Contribute to TOPS Open Science Success Stories

**What is it?**

At conferences, during webinars and community forums, and via one-on-one conversation, TOPS is collecting stories about projects and people who have demonstrated the success of open science practices. Examples of these Open Science Success Stories can be found on [science.nasa.gov](https://science.nasa.gov/open-science/transform-to-open-science/stories) and on the [TOPS GitHub](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/#readme). 

**How do I get started?**

Collect open science stories about your organization, highlighting how open science makes research teams more diverse and inclusive, and research more accessible, transparent, reproducible and replicable. You can either post these stories on your organization’s blog, webpage or podcast, or contribute to TOPS open science story project.   

**Basic Requirements**

In order to create a TOPS Open Science Story, the following elements should be included in the blog or interview:
* The interviewee’s personal definition of open science, and how it connects to [NASA’s definition](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/blob/main/docs/Area4_Moving_To_Openness/Open_Science.md) 
* A description of at least one, distinct research project or scientific initiative which demonstrates open science principles or practices. 
* Information or stories about the challenges or barriers faced when first embarking on the open science project, as well as the ultimate benefits of preserving, to help encourage others to also adopt open science. 
* If possible, post this story with a CC-BY license and share it on Zenodo or some other persistent identifier site, to facilitate sharing.
* Tweet it out! Use social media, listservs, your organization’s news page or other methods to share this story with your community.  

**TOPS Will Provide**

TOPS will provide organizations with the following support:
* Year of Open Science branding packet, including templates for stickers, presentation templates, Zoom backgrounds, and a guide for the use of NASA’s and TOPS’ logo and name
* TOPS can also provide the list of questions used when writing the initial Open Science Stories at [https://science.nasa.gov/open-science/transform-to-open-science/stories](https://science.nasa.gov/open-science/transform-to-open-science/stories) 


### Encourage Participation in the TOPS Open Science Curriculum

**What is it?**

Whether someone is looking to transition to a new way of conducting research or just getting started in their scientific career, TOPS aims to meet everyone where they are at on their open science journey. As such, one of TOPS' priorities is to develop and launch an open science curriculum that includes important definitions, tools, resources and best practices. You can learn more about the TOPS curriculum and other capacity sharing activities on [our GitHub](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/blob/main/docs/Area2_Capacity_Sharing/readme.md). 

A “fast-pass” option will be available for those who are already well-versed in open science, and current open science practitioners will be able to complete activities in order to earn the final TOPS open science badge. For those who prefer to go through the full course, micro-badges will be available at every module and the TOPS open science badge will be awarded at the end. (Why badging?
