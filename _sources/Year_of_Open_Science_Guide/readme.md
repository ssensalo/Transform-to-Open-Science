# Guide to NASA's Year of Open Science

A Guide for Participating in NASA’s Year of Open Science

*The Transform to Open Science (TOPS) mission is designed to rapidly transform agencies, organizations, and communities to an inclusive culture of open science.*

## Open Science 
Open science—opening up the scientific process from idea inception to result—increases access to knowledge and expands opportunities for participation. Sharing the data, code, results, and knowledge associated with the scientific process enables more inclusive, diverse and equitable participation in science, while also leading to more transparent, replicable and reproducible results. But achieving this openness requires changing how we work, to help us move forward together.

## NASA’s Transform to Open Science mission

To help catalyze the move to open science and support changing cultural norms, NASA is championing the Transform to Open Science (TOPS) mission and has declared 2023 as the Year Of Open Science. TOPS  is a $40 million, 5-year NASA Science Mission Directorate mission geared towards accelerating the adoption and understanding of open science. TOPS will focus on four areas of action—engagement, capacity sharing, incentives, and moving towards openness—to make progress against three goals:
* To accelerate major scientific discoveries
* To increase understanding and adoption of open science
* To broaden participation by historically underrepresented communities

These areas are designed to increase awareness about open science, provide learning resources for those looking to deepen their understanding and usage of open science practices and principles, and to promote events that support transitioning to open science. By partnering and collaborating with other organizations, NASA will support and enable the scientific community to move towards open science. 

**NASA - along with like-minded agencies across the USA government - has declared 2023 the Year of Open Science to celebrate the benefits and successes of open science, and inspire more scientists to join the movement. Ultimately, the success of the Year of Open Science will be driven by collaborations with individuals, teams, and organizations who are ready to transform the culture of federal research into one that celebrates openness, and inclusion!**

### For Individuals Who Want to Get Involved
Are you just beginning your open science journey? Perhaps you have only just begun to post your code or data online, share your pre-prints, or share your null hypothesis as part of your grant application? Or perhaps you are exploring science communication on a personal blog. All of these behaviors exemplify open science and we would like for you to join us in the Year of Open Science! 

If you are excited to learn and encourage others to learn about open science as part of the Year of Open Science, then we invite you to explore how to [Individual Actions for the Year of Open Science](/Open_Science_Cookbook/Your_Open_Science_Journey.md)!

### For Teams Who Want to Get Involved
Is your team interested in adopting open science principles and practices, but unsure of how to begin? The Year of Open Science team activities could help you reflect together on how to equip the people at your organization with practical knowledge in open science, as well as introduce them to a wider community of open science practitioners. 

Learn how to get your team involved in [Team Actions for the Year of Open Science](/Open_Science_Cookbook/Your_Teams_Open_Science_Journey.md)!

### For Entire Organizations Who Want to Get Involved
Is your organization is ready to devote people, funds, and other resources to adopting open science throughout the organization. If your leaders are committed to becoming known as an open science organization, and excited to facilitate open science research through its policy and actions, then we invite you to explore [Organization Actions for the Year of Open Science](/Open_Science_Cookbook/Your_Organizations_Open_Science_Journey.md)!
