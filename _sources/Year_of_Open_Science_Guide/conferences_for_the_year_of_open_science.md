# Conferences with TOPS for the Year of Open Science

NASA has declared 2023 as the Year of Open Science! The TOPS team will be participating at numerous conferences throughout the nation (and internationally) to encourage the wider scientific community join us in promoting, engaging with, and strengthening open science. This guide will help get you and your organization started if you wish to collaborate with us.
