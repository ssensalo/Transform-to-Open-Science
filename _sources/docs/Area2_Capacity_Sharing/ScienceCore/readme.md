# TOPS Science Curriculum: ScienceCore

The TOPS open science curriculum will be expanded to support researchers looking to engage with NASA as NASA moves to adopt more open science requirements (*e.g.*, [Scientific Information Policy](https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/science-data/science-information-policy) and [ROSES](https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-solicitations) opportunities). In addition to the skills highlighted in the [OpenCore](/docs/Area2_Capacity_Sharing/OpenCore), scientists will need to grow skills specific to their area of study. Potential ScienceCore topics are data science, using cloud computing resources, how to share biological samples, or how to utilize MakerSpaces or shared labs.

**TOPS is still developing the plan and incentive structure for the ScienceCore. If you have any ideas, utilize the GitHub discussion space and share them with us!**

## Module Descriptions

The design calls for several, individual 2.5-hour modules that focus on data science skills and domain-specific open science practices that could be taught in-person during large society meetings or during science team meetings, completed individually online, or completed via group-organized online events. 
* Each course module will be a 2.5-hour interactive learning experience with slides, videos, quizzes, and activities. 
* All content will be integrated into OpenedX 
* All content will be assigned a CC0 or CC-BY license.

# Course Enrollment and Teaching Event Plan
*This area will be updated as the content nears completion.*

## Course Incentives

* Certification and/or NASA TOPS open science [badges](/docs/Area3_Incentives/badging_motivation.md)
