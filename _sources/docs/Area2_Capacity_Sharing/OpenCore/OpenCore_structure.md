# Proposed OpenCore Structure

The purpose of the Transform to Open Science curriculum, the OpenCore, is to introduce NASA-funded scientists or future NASA-funded scientists to the benefits and principles of open science such that they can upskill and continue collaborating with NASA science activities. The OpenCore should help participants gain a nuanced **understanding** of the open science ethos and workflow, show participants the tools needed to follow an open science **process** and thus actively participante in open science communities, and help to familiarize participants with the **benefits** of open science to their research and beyond. 

Currently, no prerequisites are proposed for the Open Science Curriculum, as we want to make this course as accessible as possible. In the future, this course may itself be a prerequisite to more advanced or in-depth material, see end of this document for ideas. TOPS is also developing incentives to motivate scientists to take the course. More information on these can be found in [Area 3: Incentives](/docs/Area3_Incentives/readme.md)
