# Module 2: Open Tools & Resources

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this module, a learner will have gained hands-on experience working with different open science tools, databases/datasets, and policies. Learners should have been introduced to open science communities within their field of study.

## Suggested Module Structure

* Lesson 1: Introduction to Open Science Tools
* Lesson 2: Tools for Open Data
* Lesson 3: Tools for Open Software
* Lesson 4: Tools for Open Results
* Lesson 5: Community Stories, Resources and Policy
