# Ethos of Open Science Module For Public Comment Open

The OpenCore open science curriculum will introduce those beginning their open science journey to important definitions, tools, and resources; and provide participants at all levels recommendations on best practices from subject matter experts.The five OpenCore modules will be:
- Ethos of Open Science
- Open Tools and Resources
- Open Data
- Open Software
- Open Results

Modules are described in more detail [here](../OpenCore_structure.md).

The TOPS Open Science Module Subject Matter Experts and Leads have been hard at work over the last several months working on the OpenCore modules and we are excited to share the initial draft of the [”Ethos of Open Science” module for public comment]. This initial comment phase will be open till Wednesday, September 28, 2022. 

“Ethos of Open Science” is the first and only required module of the TOPS OpenCore curriculum. It is our expectation that Ethos of Open Science will be the most taught module. We hope for users to walk away from the course with an understanding of the best practices, community building, and inclusivity that are important to really advancing open science. We aim to create a new, inspired understanding of the importance of sharing knowledge, expanding participation in science, and opening up the entire research process so that we can ask the best questions and find the best answers.

Criteria for Review:
Please keep in mind that this is an initial review of the draft module and is not fully developed with animation, graphics, and videos. The scope of the review is to ensure the module concept and goals speak to the needs and concerns of NASA scientists - working in the open or shifting to work in the open. Please keep in mind, many scientists are not familiar with open science. 

The following criteria is requested, but not required:
- Is the content well organized and clearly written for a general science audience?
- Is the module interesting and compelling? 
- Are you motivated to take the other 4 modules?
- Is anything missing?
- Does anything need to be clarified? 
- Is there any terminology that is confusing, problematic or misused?

To access the module document please download [here]. Once ready to submit your review, please submit here. The review period will remain open until September 28, 2022.
