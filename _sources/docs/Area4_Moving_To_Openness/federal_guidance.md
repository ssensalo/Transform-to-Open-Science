## US Federal Guidance that supports moving toward open science

This provides a collection of memos, mandates, and acts that support moving towards open science practices. 

### 2013 OSTP Memo
2013 [Increasing Access to the Results of Federally Funded Scientific Research](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/ostp_public_access_memo_2013.pdf)
Also known here at NIST as the OSTP Memo, it calls for all Federal agencies with research and development expenditures above $100 million to develop a Public Access Plan to support increased public access to the results of this research – specifically data produced in the course of that research. A summary of how this is impacting science is [here](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2016/02/22/increasing-access-results-federally-funded-science)
 
### 2013 OMB Memo
[Managing Government Information as an Asset throughout its Life Cycle to Promote Interoperability and Openness](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2013/m-13-13.pdf) (2013) This memo from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) addresses the mechanisms which are being built to assist agencies in achieving open access.

### 2014 DATA Act
[Digital Accountabiity and Transparency Act of 2014](https://www.congress.gov/113/plaws/publ101/PLAW-113publ101.pdf). This is more about transparency and spending than research outputs.
