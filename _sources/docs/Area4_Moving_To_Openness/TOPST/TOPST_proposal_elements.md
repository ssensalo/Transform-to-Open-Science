# TOPST Proposal Elements
TOPST requires both an **Open-Source Science Development Plan** (replaces the Data Management Plan) and an **Equal Access Plan**. We provide more information on both below. 

## Open-Source Science Development Plan
* Proposals must submit an Open-Source Science Development Plan that describes how project materials will be openly available. 
* It must conform to [Earth Science Division guidelines](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/engage/open-data-services-and-software/). 
* The plan must describe:
     * The management of the materials developed as part of the project and how they will be released openly. 
     * If data or software are planned to be created, they each get their own subsection that includes a description of how these will be managed, archived, and shared openly. 
* The plan may be up to two pages is [anonymized](https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/viewrepositorydocument/cmdocumentid=896942/solicitationId=%7BAB776446-03A8-4C24-845D-2E5A2ADA2D5A%7D/viewSolicitationDocument=1/DAPRguidelines22SMD.pdf), is included in the main proposal PDF, immediately following the references and citations for the Science/Technical/Management Section (S/T/M) section of the proposal. 
* This Open-Source Science Development Plan replaces the standard ROSES requirement for a Data Management Plan.

## Equal Access Plan
### For TOPST F.14, Equal Access Plans are only required for Summer Schools and Virtual Cohorts

* In support of NASA's core value of Inclusion and the SMD Science Plan Strategy 4.1, Summer Schools and Virtual Cohorts proposals must include an Equal Access Plan (two additional pages are allocated for the Equal Access Plan)
* The Equal Access Plan shall:
     * Discuss how you plan to create a positive and inclusive in-person or virtual events that are specific to the proposed activities;
     * Describe any training(s) in which the team plans to participate (e.g., bystander intervention training, microaggression awareness training, etc.) to equip and train team members in such a way that they can go on to lead and contribute to other teams that are diverse and inclusive;
     * Clearly state goals for creating and sustaining a positive and inclusive working environment and describe activities to achieve these goals; and
     * Contain metrics for measuring the success of these activities. 
     * Include a brief overview of the meeting conduct principles or policies and identify one or more individuals responsible for addressing violations of them.
