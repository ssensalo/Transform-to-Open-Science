TOPST element solicits proposals for:

(1)  The development of the [ScienceCore](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/blob/main/docs/Area2_Capacity_Sharing/ScienceCore/readme.md), a discipline specific scientific use cases curriculum, 

(2) Implementation of Summer Schools to teach OpenCore, and 

(3) Implementation of Virtual Cohorts to complete OpenCore. 

The training material as well as the design of the learning activities should be targeted to audiences from undergraduate students to established scientists and managers from all science disciplines supported by NASAâ€™s Science Mission Directorate (SMD).
