# Why Use Badges? 

Research and practices by sites such as [GitHub’s badge profiles](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/personalizing-your-profile) have shown that badges work as motivation. Implementing badges in journals has been shown to increase the rate of data sharing, as well as increasing a sense of community. Additionally, badges have been used to serves as an easy check for reviewers when evaluating proposals and/or submitted work (example from OSF [here](https://osf.io/tvyxz/wiki/4.%20Incorporating%20Badge%20Visualization%20into%20Publications/)). The following resources provide further evidence and information for those wishing to learn more about the motivation of badging:

* [Psychological Science ](https://journals.sagepub.com/toc/pss/current) has an example of how badges are used to track the “openness” of a particular article
* “[Open Badges - glorified award stickers or valuable learning credentials](https://www.academia.edu/11621164/Open_Badges_-_glorified_award_stickers_or_valuable_learning_credentials)” summarizes the value of using the open badge standard pioneered by Mozilla in 2010 in order to embed meta-data associated with the achievements of the learner directly in the badge 

It is suggested that for the TOPS curriculum, participants received a badge for each module and a “grand badge” at the end of completing the course. Participants who take the fastpass option receive their badge by completing the fastpass activities described in a later section. It is further suggested that special badges be awarded for participants who complete the course while at a NASA-sponsored event, such as Summer School or Science Team Meetings, as opposed to completing it on their own. The argument is that those who take an instructor-led course then have the potential to learn from each other and form their own open science community and connections during the course. Although this is primarily aimed at digital badges which can be added to online environments, this can also be extended to passing out physical stickers, pins, patches etc. at in-person events. 


### A Badge and a Certificate 

A potential avenue for combining certification and badging is through[ IMS Global Learning Consortium’s open badges program](https://openbadges.org/). This is the avenues that the EU’s open science program is taking, with further details available [here](https://openbadges.org/). A list of all participating organizations can be found [here](https://site.imsglobal.org/certifications?page=2&refinementList%5Bstandards_lvlx%5D%5B0%5D=Open%20Badges) and the GitHub site is [here](https://gist.github.com/cmcavoy/4114344). The primary difference between the IMS standards and and GitHub’s digital badging is that IMS embeds additional information about the certification in the badge, while GitHub is currently limited to an icon that represents an achievement. This enables IMS to gather data regarding the use of the badges. 

For further recommendations on using digital badging for TOPS, please refer to the [micro-badging details page](/docs/Area3_Incentives/micro-badging_details.md).
