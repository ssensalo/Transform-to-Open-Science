# Why do digital micro-badging?

### The Bottom Line Up Front
After searching through all badge-issuing organizations which are certified by IMS–rather than just claiming to follow the open badge standard without formal verification of such–it is recommended that TOPS choose [Badgr](https://info.badgr.com/) as the micro-badging and digital badging organization of TOPS. GitHub does not support digital badges that meet the open badge standard at this time; however, [GitHub shields](https://github.com/badges/awesome-badges) can be leveraged to award those who contribute code to TOPS, either through the open software module or some other avenue. 

## Introduction
The awarding of micro-badges or micro-credentials refers to the emerging practice of recognizing specific skills or qualifications of employees, students, or community members. The terms “micro-badges” and “micro-credentials” are used rather interchangeably online, although the TOPS team prefers the term micro-badges since they can be awarded for completing a project (e.g., creating a phone app) in addition to working towards a certification. Unlike a list of skills someone adds to their LinkedIn or resume, micro-badges can be traced to the issuer–whether it be a university or an independent organization–which serves as a verification of the skills that have been earned.  

Although specific practices vary depending on the awarding organizations, there are a few common themes that help to distinguish micro-badges from other types of awards:
* Micro-badges are built to **recognize a specific skill, area of expertise or type of knowledge** (e.g., public speaking rather than leadership, animal locomotion rather than life sciences, Python fundamental of natural language processing rather than machine learning).
* Micro-badges are intended to be **portable**. In a digital environment, this indicates that they transfer well between different types of platforms or software services.
* Micro-badges are intended to break a larger area of expertise into smaller, **digestible topics**. Put another way, micro-badges are “stackable” such that many micro-badges can build towards a larger certification or qualification. This allows for individualized learning as well as learner-driven scheduling and course-work. 
* Micro-badges are also distinguishable from other digital badge types in that they are intended to be completed in **short periods of time**. This line is somewhat blurred, by the recent evolution of some universities offering micro-badges for courses that, together, result in a degree. In this case, the micro-badge (representing a course of a couple of credits) is a smaller unit than the entire degree, which requires several of these courses to be awarded. 
* Micro-badges are, inherently, a **gamification** of the learning process and are often combined with visual and playful cues (e.g., digital stickers, building and/or dressing an avatar). 

To make the micro-badge a valid, digital badge, there are a few additional requirements that must be met:
* A digital badge must be a digitally coded object that includes the achievement description, earner’s name, awarding body’s name, issue date, expiration date, and sponsor information. Rather than a static PNG, this information must be **embedded in the object’s metadata**. 
* A digital badge must be **easily shared across different platforms**, including social media, online resumes, and skill sharing sites (e.g., LinkedIn, GitHub).
* To qualify as an **Open Badge**, the digital badge must conform to a standard from [IMS Global Learning Consortium](https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/digital-badges) that is designed to make the badge portable, transparent and uniform across issuers 
If learners have been awarded a badge from an organization, they can easily check to see if the open badge is valid by using tools such as [Badge Check](https://badgecheck.io/) which is provided by the badge-issuing site Badgr. IMS Global Learning Consortium answers common questions about the Open Badge standard [here](https://openbadges.org/about/faq).
 
## Recommendations for OpenCore Micro-badging
As discussed below, it is the aim of TOPS to award learners participating in the open science core curriculum (“OpenCore”) a digital badge for completing each module. As such, the digital award for the completion of a single module is a *micro-badge*, and the digital object earned as a result of accumulating all five OpenCore micro-badges is the *badge* (or “grand badge.”) 

In the spirit of open science, it is recommended that TOPS micro-badges and badges conform to the IMS Open Badge standard as described by IMS Global Learning Consortium on their [open badge specifications page](https://www.imsglobal.org/technical-resources?field_technical_resource_tid=3796&field_technical_activity_nid=49886). The open badge standard is already created to maximize portability and transparency, and should enable learners to provide their employers, universities and funding groups with evidence–in the form of the badge’s metadata–that they have the open science skills described in each module. 

In the spirit of building community, it is further suggested that TOPS make an effort to provide those who have earned micro-badges and the OpenCore badge with physical objects that represent the achievement, in addition to the digital object. This could include a certification which can be printed, in addition to the digital badge, and pins or stickers which can be collected from TOPS or AGU at conferences. 

### Recommended Badging Services
The following organizations offer digital badging services which comply with the (a) Open Badge standard, (b) have been certified as compliant by [IMS](https://site.imsglobal.org/certifications?page=2&refinementList%5Bstandards_lvlx%5D%5B0%5D=Open%20Badges), and (c) integrate with [OpenEdx](https://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/edx-installing-configuring-and-running/en/latest/configuration/enable_badging.html#specify-a-badge-generator-other-than-badgr-server).

### What About GitHub? 
GitHub achievement badges are **not** digital badges and, unfortunately, cannot be transferred to other platforms such as LinkedIn or other virtual resumes sites. (To avoid confusion, we shall call them GitHub *shields* moving forward.) GitHub achievement shields are based on contribution to a shared repository, and often have requirements based on a certain number of commits or lines of code. Although fun to display on GitHub, these do not meet the required standards on embedded metadata to be an open badge.  

If we want to create a duplicate of our Open Software micro-badge on GitHub, that can be done using one of the services described in the [Badges Readme](https://github.com/badges/awesome-badges). In short, those who complete the open software assessment (whatever form it may take), can submit code to a shared repository to receive the GitHub TOPS open software shield. Earning the micro-badge, will be integrated with the OpenEdx course. Once TOPS has transitioned to a full-fledged Github Pages/Jekyll site, the shields can be embedded in a user’s profile. Linking the shields to the micro-badges could be done by individual users by linking the profile of their digital badge to the shield.

#### Options for Earning a GitHub Shield
The primary purpose of GitHub shields is to provide visitors to a repository with an easy way to view and understand the metadata of that repository. For example, suggested shields from [shields.io](https://github.com/badges/shields) include the release number, number of downloads per month, the “chrome stability”, or the “static code analysis grade.” Shields can also be awarded for those who commit to particular repositories or perform certain, [recognized actions](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/personalizing-your-profile#displaying-badges-on-your-profile) on GitHub. One of the most visible examples of a badge award for committing is the [Mars 2020 Helicopter Achievement](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/personalizing-your-profile#list-of-qualifying-repositories-for-mars-2020-helicopter-contributor-achievement), which awarded the shield to anyone who committed code to the project.

### Examples of Micro-Badging as Certificates
The following three examples demonstrate the use of open, digital badges in place of traditional job certification. 
* The [Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC)](https://www.cdisc.org/education/cdisc-standards-certification) requires members to take an exam that demonstrates proficiency in tabulating clinical research data. 
* [Unionlearn](https://www.unionlearn.org.uk/) is a UK trade union learning platform that supports apprenticeships and other learning opportunities, including brushing up on skills such as math and literacy. They [offer several badges](https://www.unionlearn.org.uk/digital-badges-skillcheck), each requiring the member to take an online 25-question assessment, and score at least 10 correct. 
* The [Institute of Leadership and Management](https://www.institutelm.com/) awards an initial badge just for joining the community. They then award additional badges [based on experience](https://www.institutelm.com/what-we-do/membership/membership-grade.html) or by upgrading the initial Community badge by completing at least two of their [Dimensions of Leadership courses](https://www.institutelm.com/learning/leadership-framework.html).
