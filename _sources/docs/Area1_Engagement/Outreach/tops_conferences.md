After holding some pre-proposal calls open to the public, we have received numerous questions; to address them, we will be reviewing the three components (ScienceCore, Summer Schools, and Virtual Cohorts), discussing the most frequently asked questions, and also answering any additional questions that you may have. Look forward to having you there.
