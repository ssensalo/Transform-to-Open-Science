## TOPS Collaborations Within NASA
The following are key elements of TOPS' strategy for engagement within the NASA community or TOPS' "inreach" strategy.
### Communities of Practice
A community of practice is defined as a group of people who share a craft or a profession, in this case, those participating in or advocating for open-source science within and outside of NASA. To develop a community of practice in NASA, TOPS will build awareness and acceptance of the benefits of collaborative open-source science. Our team will:
 - Create a vibrant digital community through GitHub
 - Create an informative email list
 - Provide updates using social media
 - Share success stories and co-develop articles that share open science wins
 - Develop 3 [Space Apps Challenges](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org) centered around:
    - Identifying a new method for explaining the results of a NASA research project through art, literature, music and/or some other artform to be mindful of making the scientific research explainable and accessible to those with different cultural, socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds
    - Creating a new metric (altmetrics), that monitor online reader behavior, social media interactions, applied, social, and or economic uses of open science research as a new method of evaluating research impact
    - Developing an app where users can input short, text phrases and the query is artistically matched with and returns NASA imagery that matches the phrase or thought using machine learning/artificial intelligence
 - Engage with NASA’s Minority University Research and Engagement Program (MUREP)
 - Engage stakeholders through the [ESIP Open Source Science Transformation Cluster](https://wiki.esipfed.org/Open_Science_Cluster)
### TOPS Champions
It is important to develop and maintain relationships once we’ve built them. TOPS Champions are empowered open science ambassadors that include scientists, staff, thought-leaders, community partners, academic institutions,NASA partners, and YOU! We can’t build a robust community without your help. If you want to be a TOPS Champion, contact us and [join our email list](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeb_6PdbaPYFcVwXWgMJ053Q_pF2rW2YOu51Qmrh5nWaRYc7Q/viewform)!
