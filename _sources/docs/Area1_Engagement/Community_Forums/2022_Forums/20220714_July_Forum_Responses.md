# July 25th Community Forum Survey Results
On July 25th 2022, TOPS held a community forum during which Mentimeter was used to collect anonymous survey data from the participants. The raw data can be found [here](https://zenodo.org/record/6907761#.YuLdT-zML0o) and word art created showcasing the barriers is [here](https://zenodo.org/record/6949180#.YugfIezML0o). What follows is a summary of that analysis, as well as recommendations for how this community feedback can be incorporated into TOPS.

## Barriers to Open Science
**Question: What barriers, challenges, or considerations exist for practicing science openly?** 
Responses can be grouped into the following categories, sorted (top-to-bottom) from the category most suggested to the least:
1. Lack of training in open science (26)
1. Adoption of open science is too hard, socially and culturally (22)
1. Lack of money/funds for open science (21)
1. Competition for academic/career recognition is misaligned with open science practice (21)
1. Academic tenure and promotion is misaligned with open science practice (18)
1. Lack of (or lack of access to) tools to conduct open science (8)
1. Need to update institution policies (8)
1. Lack of recognition for practicing open science (7)
1. Lack of time to practice open science (7)
1. Lack of mentorship in open science (6)
1. Lack of computing infrastructure to practice open science or store/maintain open data (6)

There are an additional twenty-three suggestions which do not neatly fit into these eleven categories, or are otherwise worth repeating. Topics which appeared multiple times are near the top. These responses have been lightly edited for grammar and/or clarity. Quotation marks indicate exact quotes:
* Open science practices are not equivalent across different scientific fields and “Maturity of FAIR/CARE/TRUST application in different scientific disciplines” and “open science training doesn’t seem relevant to specific disciplinary norms.” 
* “Lack of guidelines for contributors” and “need to recognize multiple contributors.” 
* “Convention” and “the system”
* Mentors who actively discourage open science use, due to wanting to use what they are comfortable using. “Mid-late career scientists who want to keep using existing science workflows and discourage early career scientists from contributing.”  
* Need to translate open science research and resources. “Everything is in English.” 
* Research institutions and other research-funding organizations still value research which is developed in-house. “Not developed here is still a big driver in some areas.”
* “Gatekeeping and competition in publishing research”
* “Too many repositories”
* Following open science standards is difficult 
* “Concentration of resources and opportunities in the Global North”
* “Effective metrics on reuse of open science outputs”
* “Researchers don't engage and involve the public who don't have a science degree in meaningful way”
* “Getting researchers used to integrating open science into their day to day work”
* “Always try to find a sense of place in open science.” 
* Ethics
* “Open science does not always have to be affiliated to an institution.”
* “Better documentation of best practices and roles in data management.” 
* Need to better report results of open science challenges
* “Not many [opportunities for practicing science openly] if resources and opportunities aren't allocated to the third world as well.” 


## Suggestions for Advocating for Open Science
**Question: What opportunities do you see for practicing science openly?** 
Responses can be grouped into the following categories, sorted (top-to-bottom) from the category most suggested to the least:
1. Increased collaboration and community (12)
1. Reaching meaningful results faster (8)
1. Decreasing duplication and increasing transparency of research and results (7)
1. Increased opportunities to learn (from one another, and about open science) (5)
1. Better scientific workflow (4)
1. Increased awareness of DEIA in research (2)

There are an additional thirteen suggestions which do not neatly fit into these six categories, or are otherwise worth repeating. These responses have been lightly edited for grammar and/or clarity. Quotation marks indicate exact quotes:
* Availability of open repositories
* “Partnerships with libraries who are experts in managing information.”
* “Application of science to societal needs.”
* “More subject areas becoming area of existing open science practices.”
* “Increased reward of open science activities, particularly when evaluating a science portfolio.”
* Agreement or creation of “international standards for openness.”
* Chance to “build reputation as an open science practitioner.”
* “Lead a new generation of researchers who believe in open science principles.”
* “There is a growing awareness and appetite to get open science right across a lot of disciplines.”
* Chance to create “new standards for visualization content.”
* Increase of compatible tools
* Increase of open source development
* “Many citizen science projects already use many open science practices.”
