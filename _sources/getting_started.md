# Welcome to the Transform to Open Science GitHub!

This page is your one-stop shop for uncovering the many resources for open science that are on the TOPS GitHub! Read on to learn more about how to use our GitHub, how to engage with TOPS and participate in the Year of Open Science, and identify resources to help you, your research team, and your organization get started with open science.

# How to Use This GitHub
## Understanding Your Role
Depending on your level of interaction with TOPS and the TOPS GitHub, visitors to the site can be described as: 
- A **community member**: anyone in the open science community who visits a TOPS site, utilizes TOPS online tools, or attends a TOPS event.
- A **participant**: anyone who posts a comment or poses a question in the *GitHub Discussion Space*, reports a site bug or requests a new resource in *GitHub Issues*, or attends a TOPS event and utilizes any virtual chat features during that event. 
- A **contributor**: anyone who forks this GitHub repository and submits pull requests to make additions or changes to the posted content. If you wish to be a contributor, please read our contribution guidelines [here](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). 

Everyone reading this wiki is a community member, and we hope everyone will post comments and join discussions as a participant. Contributors are welcome, particularly to help find and point to other open science resources. 

All community members must abide by the code of conduct when engaging with TOPS, either online or in-person. 

## Code of Conduct
The TOPS code of conduct can be found [here](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## GitHub Basics
There are three, major ways to contribute to the TOPS GitHub. 
- **Ask a question, provide an answer, share your thoughts and contribute to brainstorming through [Discussions](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/discussions).** The GitHub discussion area is intended for general Q&A, asking for community stories and experiences, and beginning conversations on new or existing open science topics. 
  - To learn more about GitHub Discussions check out their [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions/collaborating-with-your-community-using-discussions/about-discussions) 
- **Suggest a change, addition, or deletion to what is already on the GitHub using [Issues](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/issues).** Issues can be about any TOPS plans, timelines, and content.
  - To learn more about GitHub Issues check out their [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues)
- Become a contributor! [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the repository and [make commits](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects#making-and-pushing-changes) to add resources and additional materials. We’ve recorded a very short [how-to guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHoScPeMWHI) if you need a hand to get started.

# Transform to Open Science
The Transform to Open Science (TOPS) mission is designed to rapidly transform agencies, organizations, and communities to an inclusive culture of open science. You can learn more about the mission on the [main repository readme](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science#transform-to-open-science-tops). General Q&A about open science, TOPS, and our programs can be found in out [TOPS FAQ](/tops_faq.md) document.

TOPS has four areas of action to help us reach our [goals](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science#strategic-objectives). Use the list below to navigate to the resources and supporting materials for each area.
- [Area 1: Engagement](/docs/Area1_Engagement/readme.rst) – Building community, publishing articles, appearing on podcasts, expanding knowledge about open science, integrating Open Science into themes at large-scale events and conferences.
