So with regards to our code of conduct, we want to empower people, provide outstanding open science. And so this requires us to have an open exchange of ideas that are balanced by thoughtful guidelines, and it would be impossible for us to list everything that could create a more welcoming space for everyone. And we know this team will find ways to include colleagues that we haven’t even thought of.</p>
<p>00:00:31:44 - 00:00:57:16
Cynthia Hall
But when in doubt, we encourage to look to these principles for guidance, practice empathy and humility, participate in an authentic and active way, exercise consideration and respect. Assume that everyone we work with is doing their best work for open science. Listen carefully and actively ask questions and seek to understand your partner’s context. Encourage other people to listen as much as they speak.</p>
<p>00:00:57:39 - 00:01:37:07
Cynthia Hall
Attempt collaboration before a conflict. Treat other people’s identities and cultures with respect. Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants, and please alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress or violation of this code of conduct, even if they seem inconsequential. The primary goal of tops is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible and we expect everyone to comply with this code of conduct, communicating openly with respect for others, and critiquing ideas rather than individuals.</p>
<p>00:01:37:42 - 00:01:59:42
Cynthia Hall
Anyone not abiding by this code of conduct will be asked to leave the forum. And if you are the subject of unacceptable behavior or have witnessed any such behavior, please let our project scientists Chelle Gentemann know via chat or this is her email address. If you’d like to know more about our code of conduct and read it thoroughly, please go to our GitHub, which is this QR code.</p>
<p>00:01:59:42 - 00:02:22:12
Cynthia Hall
So to start us off, I’m Cynthia Hall. I am the community coordinator for the Transform to Open Science Project at NASA and we really again are excited to have you here and we encourage you to submit feedback or suggestions. Your input is critical to the success of our mission, and so you can use this QR code to access our feedback tool.</p>
<p>00:02:23:08 - 00:02:49:39
Cynthia Hall
We may not have time to answer them directly in this forum, but we will be posting all of the answers on our GitHub and the Frequently Asked Questions section today. Here is our agenda. I’m going to go through some top updates. We’re going to do a fun word art activity. Then I’m going to turn it over to Isabella Martinez to give an overview of the open science curriculum.</p>
<p>00:02:50:02 - 00:03:10:09
Cynthia Hall
And then we’re going to break out for about 30 minutes into rooms. And so, as Isabella mentioned earlier, if you did not register and indicate which room you’d like to go into, please post that in the chat and I will try to accommodate as I am able. Please also note that this is the first time we’re doing breakout rooms in teams.</p>
<p>00:03:10:29 - 00:03:38:54
Cynthia Hall
And so if you’ll bear with us, if we have any technological difficulties. I am so excited to announce some TOPS news. We had a wonderful summer intern over the summer, Steffie Kim. She interviewed and wrote a blog post on how people are doing science openly, what is working well, and what barriers still exist. These success stories are undergoing a NASA review and will be published very soon.</p>
<p>00:03:39:15 - 00:04:04:17
Cynthia Hall
As soon as that happens, we will make sure to let everyone know the URL via our listserv. We have some new faces at TOPS and are excited to introduce Dr. Yaitza Luna-Cruz. She’s our TOPS program Scientist and Diversity Officer. And you can find out more about Dr. Luna-Cruz on her Twitter or LinkedIn. We also have two new NASA scientists helping us grow TOPS. From Goddard Space Flight Center.</p>
<p>00:04:04:17 - 00:04:32:04
Cynthia Hall
We are excited to be working with Heliophysicist Dr. Ryan McGranaghan, a strong advocate for open science, and from Ames Research Center and Bioinformatics Specialists, Dr. Sam Gebre. She works at NASA’s GeneLab, where they practice open science for life and space. And so we’re very excited to welcome them all. Finally, we want to let you all know that a TOPS funding announcement for the year of Open Science Activities, Resources and events will be released very soon.</p>
<p>00:04:32:27 - 00:04:59:36
Cynthia Hall
If you aren’t already on our email list, we recommend you join so that you will be notified when it is released. You can also find us on Twitter &#64;ToOpenScience. Please engage with us there. We would love to interact with you. I would also like to note that we have some truly inspirational stories from some of our opencore curriculum subject matter experts.</p>
<p>00:04:59:36 - 00:05:40:00
Cynthia Hall
You can find those on the TOPS GitHub. The Slide Deck is a PDF that provides links to all of these use cases. Lastly, I’d like to notify you of an open source science data repositories workshop that’s going to be held in late September. It is virtual with an option for in-person attendance at Langley Research Center. And basically we’d like to ask you to join the Chief Science Data Office on a four day workshop to engage with NASA data repositories on the next steps in sharing NASA’s scientific information and open science.</p>
<p>00:05:40:27 - 00:06:13:38
Cynthia Hall
You can see the themes here which cover core data and computing services. We’ll talk a little bit about the TOPS program there. SMD, which is the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Policies and Standards. And then we definitely want to make sure to include diversity, equity and inclusion as that is the heart of this open science initiative. At our last forum held in July, we asked the community about the barriers of practicing open science, and we made this fun word art.</p>
<p>00:06:13:38 - 00:06:43:52
Cynthia Hall
From the responses, clearly you can see some themes have popped out. Some barriers include training, more time and effort to do open science, funding, rewards, policies, the competition factor and more. And we’d like to you can find this word art on our GitHub as well as on Zenodo. But right now we’d like to hear from you again and we will create another fun word art from your responses.</p>
<p>00:06:44:15 - 00:07:50:10
Cynthia Hall
But if you’ll please go to the following Menti site using that QR code, the Menti URL there or just go to Menti.com and use the code 9076 9202 and tell us in your own words, how do you define open science? So as you type in your responses will have them popping up here… I see accessibility, collaborative research that is freely shared with all, free access, transparency, collaborative, collaboration, equitable, inclusion, transparent and better science.</p>
<p>00:07:50:10 - 00:08:19:07
Cynthia Hall
So please continue to add your responses in there. We’re excited to see where that ends up and we’ll again be collecting all of those responses and will make a fun word art and make it available on our GitHub and on Zendodo. And so again, please continue to put your responses in there. But right now I’d like to turn it over to Chelle Gentemann who is going to introduce Isabella Martinez.</p>
<p>00:08:19:07 - 00:08:21:59
Chelle Gentemann
Hi, everyone. Thanks again so much for joining us.</p>
<p>00:08:22:34 - 00:08:23:42
Chelle Gentemann
This is our first time using.</p>
<p>00:08:23:42 - 00:08:57:52
Chelle Gentemann
Teams, so we apologize about all of the beeping this people are joining. We will have that figured out for the next one. So I’m really happy to introduce Isabella Martinez. She’s been a really core member of the TOPS community over the last few months where we’ve been working to try and imagine what a broad, accessible, interactive, open science curriculum that would be useful to both NASA scientists and also science adjacent communities and all scientists.</p>
<p>00:08:58:15 - 00:09:04:06
Chelle Gentemann
So, Isabella, thanks and take it away.</p>
<p>00:09:04:56 - 00:09:38:25
Isabella Martinez
Thank you, Chelle And thank you, Cyndi, and rest of the team for including me in today’s presentation. So I shall said my name is Isabella Martinez. My pronouns are she hers. My academic training is in biomedical engineering. My research is in the applications of quantum computing, and my lived experience is as a first generation Latina American. I said, I’m currently the TOPS curriculum curator and I’m here today to ask all of you to bring your academic training, your research experience, and your lived experience to the table.</p>
<p>00:09:38:37 - 00:10:07:11
Isabella Martinez
As we discuss the content and design for the TOPS open science curriculum, both the basic open science curriculum, which we have called the open core, as well as what is going to be created beyond the open core. The TOPS open science curriculum is primarily being designed so that NASA funded scientists or future NASA funded scientists are able to learn about open science and upscale in order to continue collaborating with other NASA scientists.</p>
<p>00:10:07:31 - 00:10:28:49
Isabella Martinez
This has three core pillars: Understanding learners needs to be able to gain nuanced understanding of the ethos of open science as well as practical, hands on experience, so that they can put those open science practices into the way that they do research currently. We want participants to be able to follow an open science process and actively participate in open science communities.</p>

And finally, we really hope that the open core is going to familiarize everybody with open tools and practices. I just lost the slides. As I said, this is our first time using teams. I’m going to go ahead and display my version. So apologies as we try out this new technology.</p>
<p>00:11:06:39 - 00:11:14:26
Cynthia Hall
Sorry about that, Isabella. I was sharing, but I don’t know what happened. So thank you again. As Isabella said, for bearing with us.</p>
<p>00:11:15:27 - 00:11:48:43
Isabella Martinez
Yeah. So I’m actually going to jump ahead in the agenda. The reason that we were really interested in using teams today is that teams, because of the abilities to record transcriptions in breakout rooms without also having to to create a recording. The reason we wanted to do that is we really want to create a space where everyone feels comfortable talking about the way that they have struggled to adopt open science either now or in the past, and give everybody an opportunity to talk about what they would ideally want in an open core curriculum that is primarily aimed at helping people who are beginners begin their open science journey.</p>
<p>00:11:49:36 - 00:12:16:39
Isabella Martinez
This is why we are using teams versus something that we have tried before, but as you can see, it’s a little bit buggy. This is what happens when you’re working in the open. Thank you so much for displaying your screen. I think I’m ready to go on to the next slide. Thank you, everybody. So the structure of the TOPS Open Core is focused on five modules based on research that has been done by open science communities.</p>
<p>00:12:16:39 - 00:12:42:35
Isabella Martinez
In the past. We felt that breaking up the open core into these five topics was going to give everybody what they needed in order to get started. Of course, we begin with an introduction ethos of open science. What are the benefits of open science and the challenges to adapting it into your own scientific practice? Now we move into using open tools and then open data, software and results, discussing how to create data, software and results, how to share them and how to use them effectively and responsibly.</p>
<p>00:12:43:45 - 00:13:06:58
Isabella Martinez
Next slide, please Chelle.b By the end of the Ethos to Open Science Module, we hope that learners will be familiar with the definitions that are central to open science. They will have explored some concrete examples of those benefits. We hope that it will give everybody the best practices for building and collaborating with the open science community while also introducing the principles which are key to an open science workflow and project.</p>
<p>00:13:07:22 - 00:13:36:40
Isabella Martinez
And finally, we hope that this module will explore how Open science seeks to create a more diverse, equitable and inclusive and accessible scientific community as well as accessible and transparent research. We are hoping to structure the module by beginning with an introduction, moving into the principles, focusing on communities, then the benefits and challenges, and finally ending with uplifting and inspiring open science stories such as those that are open court subject matter experts have already shared on the GitHub.</p>
<p>00:13:36:40 - 00:13:57:32
Isabella Martinez
The next slide describes the module objectives for the Open Tools and Resources module. By the end of this module, we hope that learners will gain a hands on experience working with different open science tools, databases and datasets as well as frameworks. We hope that learners will also be exposed to communities, or at least exposed to how to find communities which are specific to their scientific disciplines.</p>
<p>00:13:58:12 - 00:14:37:11
Isabella Martinez
The structure of this module will focus first on introduction to tools for open science generally before diving into what is going to be covered in the next three modules, data, software and results. And finally, end of community stories. Again, the data, software and results modules we hope will be structured a little bit. Similarly, in order to provide flow between the different models, we’re going to begin with using open data software results, making open data software a result, and then finally sharing open data software results with community stories sprinkled throughout to give a hands on and practical examples to how open data, open software and open results are building a more inclusive scientific community as well</p>
<p>00:14:37:11 - 00:14:56:47
Isabella Martinez
as more transparent and replicable research. The open data model is centered on the use of data repositories, both as a user and as a contributor. By the end of the module, we’re hoping that learners should feel comfortable creating a data management plan that follows their principles. That is, data which is findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable by both humans and machines.</p>
<p>00:14:57:12 - 00:15:20:31
Isabella Martinez
This includes assigning a license and copyright and following, because we are primarily looking for NASA scientists., US law. Learners should feel comfortable creating and utilizing metadata as well, citing data collected by others in their own work. The next module will be open software and will primarily focused on code sharing practices. We hope by the end of this module learners will understand the impact of open source code.</p>
<p>00:15:20:42 - 00:15:46:57
Isabella Martinez
Have hands on experience choosing the license, creating a reading and uploading code to GitHub and GitLab. We hope that learners will understand the importance of high quality documented code, but will also be exposed to why open source software can be used to advance equity in scientific fields. And finally, the open results module, as well as including a discussion of open access, will go beyond the publication of results and talk about the importance of transparency.</p>
<p>00:15:46:57 - 00:16:24:29
Isabella Martinez
Replicability and reproducibility therefore rounding out the entirety of the open core by the end of the module We hope learners understand what steps they need to take when choosing where to publish their results and their research artifacts, as well as have an understanding of a replicable open science workflow. So this is the TOPS core team vision for the open core and our open open core open science subject matter experts have been working on module topics as they fit into these models as introduced today.</p>
<p>00:16:25:01 - 00:16:51:20
Isabella Martinez
However, the rest of today, the next 30 minutes at least, are focused on you, your research, your academic training, your lived experiences. What do you think a beginner needs to know in order to get started with open science and each of these topics, do you feel that these learning objectives are well-suited for someone who is new to open science and what could be added or removed from the models in order to better introduce a beginner to this aspect of open science?</p>
<p>00:16:51:49 - 00:17:12:04
Isabella Martinez
But we also want people who’ve already begun their open science practice and maybe one of these areas, but not the others. And to get a refresher, to become more familiar with the benefits and challenges of open science, and to feel like we are forming an open science community together. Before we move on, I want to remind everybody that we will not be recording the breakout rooms, but we will be transcribing.</p>
<p>00:17:12:20 - 00:17:38:21
Isabella Martinez
We are using transcription which will then be anonymized before being posted to our Google drive as well as our GitHub, so that we can create a space where people feel comfortable sharing their experiences without feeling that their concerns are necessarily going to be displayed to the whole world. And there’s also an alternative way to participate beyond turning on your video and turning on your mic, which is that we have a jam board with each of the breakout room.</p>
<p>00:17:38:21 - 00:18:05:59
Isabella Martinez
Moderators will post in the chat once we move into our breakout room. A reminder as well that if you leave a breakout room, you are not sent back to the lobby, as if when we’re in Zoom or WebEx. You exit the teams entirely and will have to join the meeting again. All right, hopefully this works. We are excited about this transcription feature, but technology sometimes doesn’t work the way you want it to, particularly in a meeting this large. Cyndi if you could open the breakout rooms.</p>
<p>00:18:05:59 - 00:18:10:38
Isabella Martinez
I look forward to speaking with those in my breakout rooms soon and in reconvening in 30 minutes.</p>
