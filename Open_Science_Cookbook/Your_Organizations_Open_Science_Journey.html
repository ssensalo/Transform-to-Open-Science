<h1>Guide for Your Organization’s Open Science Journey<a class="headerlink" href="#guide-for-your-organization-s-open-science-journey" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h1>
<p>In recent decades, the technological barriers to participating in open science have decreased, but barriers due to policy, bureaucracy, funding, and culture remain. Fully engaging with open science is thus dependent on individuals entering into dialogue with their institutions, universities, agencies and companies to identify changes–both small and large–which will support the movement towards open science.</p>
<p>Building on the work of others over the past several years, TOPS invites individuals, agencies, academic institutions and other organizations to examine the kind of science which they support and encourage, and move towards a more open framework. Join us in our journey, and encourage the pursuit of open scientific progress!</p>
<p>Suggestions for how to get those in your organization excited about open science, as well as how to have some tough discussions about policy, are in <strong>Section 1: Engage with Open Science</strong>.</p>
<p>Interested in learning how you can collaborate with TOPS? Jump ahead to <strong>Section 2: Collaborate with TOPS</strong>.</p>
<p>Already know you want TOPS at your organization’s next big meeting? Check out the <a class="reference internal" href="../Year_of_Open_Science_Guide/conferences_for_the_year_of_open_science.html"><span class="doc std std-doc">conferences guide for 2023</span></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Is your entire organization ready to embark on an open science journey?</strong></p>

<h2>Section 1: Engage with Open Science<a class="headerlink" href="#section-1-engage-with-open-science" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<section id="highlight-open-science-in-your-organization">
<h3>Highlight Open Science in Your Organization<a class="headerlink" href="#highlight-open-science-in-your-organization" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Consider your organization’s current open science practice: do researchers use or share open-source code, are pre-prints encouraged or required, is data added to a database or are studies pre-registered? What policies are in place regarding sharing code, instrument data, user surveys, methodology and results? How about instructions regarding licenses and copyrights?</p>
<p>Those beginning their open science journey often worry that they aren’t truly engaging in “open science” if they are unable to practice openness in every way. At TOPS, we believe it is better to get started and do what you can, than let perfect be the enemy of progress. Show those at your organization how you are beginning an open science journey, by making it easier for everyone to find and access the relevant resources and policies.</p>
<p><strong>Getting Started</strong></p>
<p>Start by examining official policies that are already in place, including any that mention pre-registration, pre-prints, open access, code, data, research artifacts, publication, licenses, copyrights, meta-data, persistent digital identifiers, digital object identifiers, and/or collaboration. Collect the relevant policies in one location and, if possible, write a “directory” to passages in these policies that align with open science principles. Next, examine any “unofficial” policies; what are the research norms at your organization? Can any be updated to be more inclusive, equitable, accessible, or transparent? Address some of these, as appropriate, in a statement that accompanies the new open science directory.</p>
<p>When highlighting how your organization is already engaging in open science, you are doing more than just sharing projects that were done according to open science principles; you are also giving those just beginning their open science journey a model to follow. Therefore, to ensure the success of these researchers, we recommend the following be included in the blog, web-page, or meeting in which you list the relevant policies and practices:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Directory of organizational policies which include open science principles</p></li>
<li><p>Examples (provide links) of publications that followed the open science policies that you are highlighting. The projects chosen may not be good examples of every open science principle, and that is okay! Describe what was done well, and point to the relevant organizational practice and/or policy.</p></li>

<h3>Join the TOPS Movement<a class="headerlink" href="#join-the-tops-movement" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>To help catalyze the move to open science and support changing cultural norms, NASA is championing the Transform to Open Science (TOPS) mission. As part of that mission, NASA has decreed that <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/blob/main/Year_of_Open_Science_Guide/readme.md"><strong>2023 as the Year Of Open Science</strong></a>. But it does not stop there. TOPS is a growing, global initiative rooted in community values that aims to spark change and inspire broad open science engagement. Through TOPS <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science#implementation">four areas of action</a>, the mission will increase awareness about open science, provide learning resources, and host and co-host events to support a cultural transition to open science.</p>
<p><strong>Through collaboration with other organizations, NASA will support and enable the scientific community to move towards open science.</strong> The following list of planned activities represents the areas in which TOPS aims to take action to transform towards open science. If you and your organization are ready to add your strength–via your people, resources, and work–to this transformation, we invite you to join us in these areas of action.</p>

<h3>Develop Governance Frameworks and Policies to Support Open Science Action Plans<a class="headerlink" href="#develop-governance-frameworks-and-policies-to-support-open-science-action-plans" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>There are several cultural and institutional barriers which have prevented the adoption of open science in the past. Some of these are born from the academic incentive system, while others are reinforced by the desire to capitalize research. Organizations with clear policies that support the sharing of resources, data, code, and results such that they can be utilized by others encourage the adoption of open science.</p>
<p>Open Science Action Plans (OSAPs) are comprehensive strategy documents designed to advance adoption of open science practices. They should document</p>
<p>(1) what an organization is doing well,</p>
<p>(2) where there are areas for improvement, and</p>
<p>(3) detail specific actions that the organization will take to address the areas of improvement.</p>
<p>Some organizations may be hesitant to publicly commit themselves to OSAPs; it can be difficult to admit areas where there is still work to be done. Part of adopting open science is becoming more comfortable sharing our failures – as individuals and organizations – as well as our successes. Honestly sharing a current status, publishing lessons learned, and announcing ideas for moving forward are exactly the open science practices that TOPS and the greater open science community are advocating scientists adopt.</p>
<p>One possible starting point for an OSAP  is to use the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.unesco.org/science-sustainable-future/open-science/recommendation">UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science</a> which sets out 7 areas of action to advance open science. Within that report, there are specific examples for different types of organizations.</p>
<p>These areas of action are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Promoting   a   common   understanding   of   open   science,   associated   benefits   and   challenges, as well as diverse paths to Open Science</p></li>
<li><p>Developing an enabling policy environment for open science</p></li>
<li><p>Investing in open science infrastructures and services</p></li>
<li><p>Investing in human resources, education, digital literacy and capacity building for open science</p></li>
<li><p>Fostering a culture of open science and aligning incentives for open science</p></li>
<li><p>Promoting innovative approaches for open science at different stages of the scientific process</p></li>
<li><p>Promoting  international  and  multistakeholder  cooperation  in  the  context  of  open  science, and in view of reducing digital and knowledge gaps</p></li>
</ul>
<p>UNESCO also <a class="reference external" href="https://en.unesco.org/science-sustainable-future/open-science/recommendation">provided guidance</a> to consider “the development of a monitoring framework with qualitative and quantitative indicators, within national strategic plans and shared at the international level, with objectives and actions in the short, medium and long term for the implementation of the present.”</p>
<p><strong>Getting Started</strong></p>
<p>The US federal government has <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/tree/main/docs/Area4_Moving_To_Openness/Open_Timeline.md">taken steps </a>towards mandating the open sharing of publications and data produced by US government funding. Additionally, there are several <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/tree/main/docs/Area4_Moving_To_Openness/global_policies.md">global policies</a> supporting the move to open science. Organizations should begin by examining their own publication and data management policies and frameworks to ensure that they complement these. In some cases, organizations may need to provide greater detail or guidance than what exists in federal documents, to account for the needs and practices of a particular community or scientific field.</p>
<p>To develop policies which truly advance open science, we recommend the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In addition to examining the relevant <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/tree/main/docs/Area4_Moving_To_Openness/Open_Timeline.md">US Federal guidance</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/tree/main/docs/Area4_Moving_To_Openness/global_policies.md">global guidance</a>, organizations should examine the practices of the most popular journals or publication venues for the researchers of their organization. Any conflicting guidance should be noted, and addressed in the frameworks created for your organization.</p></li>
<li><p>The TOPS definition of open science includes opening data, software, results and methods; in addition to committing to principles of transparency, accessibility, inclusivity and reproducibility. Consider committing to a definition of open science at your organization, and build policies and frameworks that support it.</p></li>
<li><p>Be sure to include your organization’s researchers and scientists in the process of creating new policies; hold listening sessions, town halls, or office hours in which those most affected by these policies can provide feedback, and perhaps reveal barriers to their adoption.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What’s Next?</strong></p>
<p>Once an ‘open science plan’ is developed, ideally it is shared publicly along with a dashboard that shows progress with clearly defined metrics. Some example activities that could be a part of that plan are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Science Associations:</strong> Designate 1 day of annual meetings to focus on open science education. This could include workshops, tutorials, and showcases, and should aim to represent all the aspects of participating in and contributing to open science. This would reach a large percentage of the scientific community and create an urgency around learning to use these new tools to conduct research. Advance ability to publish software research notebooks alongside research results. Create open science awards and include open science activities in criteria for existing honors where possible. Allow award nominations to include teams.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Federal Agencies:</strong> Designate 1 day each month to advance open science practices. Remove bureaucratic barriers to open science, incentivise open science activities, and provide training opportunities for learning open science tools. Update agency evaluation and promotion criteria and guidelines to better enable participation in open science. Set agency workforce training goals aligned with doing open science and learning the tools to work collaboratively and openly.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Institutions:</strong> Update evaluation and promotion criteria to include recognition of open science activities. Incorporate open science best practices into graduate and undergraduate curricula. Update intellectual property guidelines to align with open initiatives. Develop open science cohorts within departments to support the move towards openness. Develop open science practices and encourage the use of collaborative cloud computing environments for research.</p></li>

<h4>Discuss: Research and Data Products<a class="headerlink" href="#discuss-research-and-data-products" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Consider the data held in trust by your organization.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Where can researchers find your data? What is your process/method for releasing data? Can portions of it be anonymized such that it can be shared? Is the process for requesting access to your data clear? How fast is the data request process and how often do you go through the process of releasing data? Does your organization have practices around pre-registration and archiving? Are these practices well-known and front-of-mind?</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.re3data.org/">Registry of Research Data Repositories</a> is an example site for finding open databases</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>If your organization produces research, consider if:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Research plans may be made available, prior to the start of the project,</p></li>
<li><p>That reproducibility/replicability studies be valued and encouraged, and</p></li>
<li><p>That null/negative results be published.</p></li>
<li><p>Some examples of making research plans available can be found at <a class="reference external" href="https://aspredicted.org/">AsPredicted</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://osf.io/">Open Science Framework</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="https://cos.io/rr/">Registered Reports</a></p></li>
<li><p>Examples of journals that publish negative/nul results include Positively Negative (PLOS One), The Missing Pieces: A Collection of Negative; Null and Inconclusive Results (PLOS One), The All Results Journals, ACS Omega (ACS Publications), F1000Research, PeerJ, Journal of Negative Results in Biomedicine, Journal of Negative Results: Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Journal of Articles in Support of the Null Hypothesis, Journal of Pharmaceutical Negative results and Nature Scientific Reports</p></li>
<li><p>Examples of journals that publish reproducibility/replicability studies are PLOS ONE, and <a class="reference external" href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/rsos/replication-studies">Royal Society</a></p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>For research produced <em>for</em> your organization:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Do you require that the list of materials, study methods, and computational environment be included in the final results which are shared publicly? If not, consider making this a requirement of the project.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>For data or research produced <em>by</em> your organization:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In what languages is the research available? Are bilingual researchers encouraged to apply for funding? Or, better yet, publish in multiple languages?</p></li>
<li><p>Consider adding extensions to your databases, publication sites, or other methods of sharing data to allow for easy translation into other languages.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Does your organization develop software?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Can this code be made publicly available via GitHub, BitBucket or other mechanisms?</p></li>
<li><p>Consider how much of the work of your group ought to be kept “closed” and how much can be made available to advance the work of others, particularly young professionals and early career researchers.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="discuss-metrics-and-incentives">
<h4>Discuss: Metrics and Incentives<a class="headerlink" href="#discuss-metrics-and-incentives" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If your organization conducts research, consider the metrics used when evaluating professors, researchers, lab assistants etc. for promotions and opportunities.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What do these metrics <em>actually</em> measure? Do these metrics account for historic bias, institutional bias, or other inclusivity or accessibility considerations? Do these metrics account for time and effort spent on research that ultimately produced null and/or negative results?</p></li>
<li><p>Explore using alternative metrics that value transparency, reproducibility, replicability, and access. In particular, consider metrics which reflect readability and accessibility of software, code, and data, to encourage and reward researchers who spend time and resources on data science principles</p></li>
<li><p>To learn more about this topic, explore work by <a class="reference external" href="https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/8/6/giz053/5506490">Fire and Guestrin</a>; <a class="reference external" href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpclett.5b00910">Beall</a>; and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4987709/">Carpenter, Cone and Sarli</a> in analyzing the impact of traditional metrics for journal publications and research merit</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Does your institution incentive and reward researchers in which the primary output of the research is code or software development? Consider highlighting work which results in “good code” and valuing publication in “code first” journals equally to those published in other, more traditional journals.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Journal of Open Source Software and Journal of Open Research Software are two examples of journals which allow for the “traditional” publication of code</p></li>
<li><p>According to <a class="reference external" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2021.120882">Suominen <em>et al</em></a> motivating forces for researchers and scientists are “curiosity, good practice, high-quality science, and making a difference” while de-motivating factors include “collaboration problems, competition, and lack of feedback and recognition for management.” The article goes on to conclude that motivating factors tend to be intrinsic, while the de-motivating factors were often environmental at the organization where the researcher worked.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider your organization’s current incentive and recognition structure: is it recognizing motivating factors in those it hires, promotes and praises?</p></li>
<li><p>Consider the overall structure for management of research: are any of the de-motivating factors present? Such factors can be minimized by providing researchers with opportunities (both informal and formal) to network, ask for and receive constructive feedback and share their work with those in other fields in addition to their own.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>It is the suggestion of the <a class="reference external" href="https://doi.org/10.17226/26308">National Academy of Sciences</a> that organizations which are committed to moving towards and advocating for open science should consider the language which is used not only in grants and calls for proposals, but also in prompts for cover letters and resumes, to ensure that the ethos of open science is consistently present.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For example, are applicants for a job asked about their commitment to open science in their recent work? Are post-docs encouraged to make their data open when conducting their work?</p></li>
<li><p>An excellent resource on this topic can be found in the <a class="reference external" href="https://doi.org/10.17226/26308">National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2021.

<section id="discuss-representation-mentoring-training">
<h4>Discuss: Representation, Mentoring &amp; Training<a class="headerlink" href="#discuss-representation-mentoring-training" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What is the “signaling language” used in grant applications, job postings, and descriptions of research conducted at your organization?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Does this language imply open or closed science practice? Consider updating language where appropriate.</p></li>
<li><p>In particular, if your organization has an employee or researcher handbook, review it for language that signals a preference for open or closed science practices. For example, stressing commercialization of ideas encourages people to <em>not</em> share their findings in case it could become valuable intellectual property or trade secrets in the future. In contrast, stressing the data sharing can directly enforce an open science ethos.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>If your organization hires post-docs: are the postdocs also encouraged to engage in open science, or are they measured against different metrics than other researchers?</p></li>
<li><p>If your organization provides or manages funds for research, consider how the funds are used. Beyond producing results, are funds used for…</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Research at the intersection of science and society?</p></li>
<li><p>Research done by underrepresented/minority researchers?</p></li>
<li><p>Research done to directly support underrepresented/minority communities?</p></li>
<li><p>Research done by early career researchers?</p></li>
<li><p>Research done by students (undergraduate and graduate levels)?</p></li>
<li><p>Research done to replicate and/or reproduce other studies?</p></li>
<li><p>Research that produces code? (And do the requirements maintain that this code must be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable?)</p></li>
<li><p>Research that produces data? (And do the requirements maintain that the data must be properly assigned metadata and be made available alongside the results OR prior to the results being published OR in a publicly accessible database so that others may use it?)</p></li>
<li><p>Research in which the primary result is code or software development?</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Does your organization provide training in open science practices such as the use of open databases, or the sharing of open-source software? How about training in bias and anti-bias practices both in the distribution of funding, and in the interpretation of research results (e.g., data dredging, p-hacking and HARK-ing)?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Consider adopting and adapting the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/tree/main/docs/Area2_Capacity_Sharing/OpenCore/readme.md">TOPS Open Science curriculum</a>, the work of the European Union’s <a class="reference external" href="https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/toolkit">FOSTER project</a> or/and what has been done by the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.bitss.org/resource-library/">Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences (BITSS)</a> to your needs and incentivizing funded researchers to learn more about open science.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Does your organization have access to makerspaces?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Who can use them? Are they open to all or only to a certain group?</p></li>
<li><p>Consider creating a pathway for community members–particularly high schoolers, study teams organized via libraries, Girl and Boy Scouts, YMCAs, and other organized youth groups–to be able to apply to use these spaces.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Does your organization have a structured mentoring program for early career researchers? If not, consider creating one. If one already exists, consider incorporating themes of open science into the program.</p></li>

<section id="additional-recommendations-for-academic-institutions">
<h4>Additional Recommendations for Academic Institutions<a class="headerlink" href="#additional-recommendations-for-academic-institutions" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>Some recommendations are most appropriate for academic institutions to tackle, as they relate to academic coursework. We have listed a few of these here, and additionally invite those interested to explore the <a class="reference external" href="https://mitl.pubpub.org/pub/future-of-libraries/release/1">Open-Access recommendations by MIT</a>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Are both undergraduate and graduate students required to learn about proper statistical analysis and inference?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In particular, do your students understand common problems with statistical analysis which can lead to a lack of accessibility, replicability, and/or reproducibility of the results (e.g., p-hacking, cherry-picking)?</p></li>
<li><p>Consider making such knowledge a central tenet of STEM courses at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>For researchers who conduct “field work:”</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How do they work with the communities in the field they are studying? If they are being immersed into a community, culture and/or society other than their own, what are your institution’s practices and suggestions for that interaction? Are they required to know the language? Study the history and context? Are they required to have partners who are of that community, culture and/or society on their research team?</p></li>
<li><p>Consider if your institution may benefit from adjusting the metrics for success in these situations, to include time and incentive for researchers to fully engage with the people most closely affected–either directly or indirectly–by their work.</p></li>
<li><p>On a related note, are STEM majors and those pursuing graduate studies in STEM encouraged to study other languages and/or cultures? Are the requirements for a major structured in such a way that they have room in their schedules to pursue those interests? Studying other languages can be a great way to begin to understand the motivations of another community. Next time you review requirements, consider this: what do the requirements of these majors teach students about what is important?</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>We invite academic institutions to read the work of <a class="reference external" href="https://mitl.pubpub.org/pub/future-of-libraries/release/1">MIT’s Future of the Libraries Task Force</a> from 2016 and consider whether those recommendations, particularly those related to open access, are applicable to your library system.</p></li>

<h3>Budget for Year of Open Science Activities<a class="headerlink" href="#budget-for-year-of-open-science-activities" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>
<p>The Year of Open Science will activate our communities, encouraging everyone to adopt and champion open science practices. TOPS invites all organizations to join us on the Year of Open Science, and suggests that organizations set aside a budget for targeted activities best suited to transform the culture in your organization.</p>
<p><strong>How do I get started?</strong></p>
<p>This collaboration guide has examples of several Year of Open Science activities, including hackathons, open science training, webinars, listening sessions, and town halls. The employees of your organization may be more motivated to participate in these if they are compensated for their time; and some of the activities require funding for the resources necessary to complete them. Decide on the Year of Open Science strategy that works for you, and consider if pre-existing budgets–for example, for training–can be utilized.</p>

<section id="host-a-hackathon">
<h3>Host a Hackathon<a class="headerlink" href="#host-a-hackathon" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>
<p>Hackathons have become popular in recent years as a mechanism for getting software developers, engineers, researchers and scientists together to think up out-of-the-box solutions for interesting or difficult problems. In addition to working on the problems at hand, hackathon participants often attend workshops or presentations, create a final poster or presentation, and have an opportunity to mingle with sponsors or leaders. We suggest hosting a hackathon with an open science theme! Use either NASA or your own organization’s open data to tackle a new problem; or challenge participants to think of a new way to overcome a barrier to adopting open science!</p>
<p><strong>How do I get started?</strong></p>
<p>There are several resources available for organizations who have not hosted hackathons in the past. At minimum, you will need a team that will act as the hackathon coordinators, and can arrange the (physical or virtual) venue, advertise the event, help participants sign-up and choose a team, find speakers, and arrange prizes.</p>
<p><strong>Basic Requirements</strong></p>
<p>A hackathon with a Year of Open Science theme should, at minimum:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Use open data when solving the presented challenges.</p></li>
<li><p>Post all code generated by the hackathon openly, with as unrestrictive a license as possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Collaborate on the hackathon as openly as possible, using open science frameworks such as <a class="reference external" href="https://osf.io/">Open Science Framework</a>.</p></li>

<h3>Host a Webinar on Using Your Organization’s Open Data or Open Software<a class="headerlink" href="#host-a-webinar-on-using-your-organizations-open-data-or-open-software" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>
<p>Does your organization have data, software, or publications which are freely available or only require a free login to access? Are members of your organizations aware of these resources? Are people not affiliated with your organization aware of these resources? To boost the usage of the open data, open-source software, or other open scientific information of which your organization is a steward, we recommend hosting a virtual webinar or town hall on how to use that information!</p>
<p><strong>How do I get started?</strong></p>
<p>Prior to scheduling the session, make sure to gather any instructions related to accessing, downloading, and properly citing the data or software. If possible, plan a demo related to an open science project for the webinar, and focus on best practices for using your organization’s data or software. Be sure to record and create a transcript of the session, and upload them to your organization’s website along with any access instructions.</p>
<p><strong>Basic Requirements</strong></p>
<p>To help make this event a success, we recommend the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If your organization has open data, open-source software, a preprint or open access server, and free resources for scientific analysis we recommend <em>not</em> trying to cover them all in a single webinar. Instead, consider putting on a webinar series, with each event focusing on one type of scientific information. Similarly, if your organization has multiple types of data, with special access instructions for each type, consider splitting that webinar into a multi-part series, too.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure that the instructions for accessing your organization’s open scientific information are easy to find. Clearly display any limitations to the usage of the data or software, and include instructions for citing the data and code of others.</p></li>
<li><p>If possible, include a demo of using the data, software etc. during the webinar, and use  that to highlight those in your organization already engaged in open science.</p></li>
<li><p>Contact TOPS to amplify your event! We can send your event series to our listserv and amplify your Tweets.</p></li>

<section id="sponsor-an-award">
<h3>Sponsor an Award<a class="headerlink" href="#sponsor-an-award" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>
<p>Your organization has researchers and scientists who have been practicing open science, perhaps even without knowing they were doing so! Similarly, one of the greatest barriers to the wide-spread adoption of open science is the worry that a large amount of time will be sunk into open science activities—pre-registering studies, releasing pre-prints, documenting code or assigning meta-data—and that the work will ultimately not be recognized. To encourage individuals to adopt additional open science practices, and to reward those who have already been practicing open science, we recommend creating open science awards!</p>
<p><strong>How do I get started?</strong></p>
<p>Although the word “awards’’ conjures images of a Nobel prize or an Oscar, smaller awards that are specific to your organization are just as valuable for your community. Consider the culture of your organization and how you recognize leaders, innovators, and trail blazers. Can you create an award recognizing open science practices in action that can be presented at an all-hands? If your organization funds research, consider an award that recognizes open science practices in work conducted using your funding. If your organization has a yearly conference or workshop, consider honoring those who conduct open science at those events!</p>
<p><strong>Basic Requirements</strong></p>
<p>We suggest the following considerations when creating an open science award:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The award should consider whether the person, team or project being recognized is transparent, accessible, inclusive and reproducible.</p></li>
<li><p>The award must consider individuals and teams with a diversity of experience, including diversity with respect to race, gender, geography, country of citizenship, academic background, profession, and areas of expertise.</p></li>
<li><p>The award should recognize at least one aspect of open science practice, this could include, but is not be limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Use and inclusion of open-source software, code sharing practices, and open-source repositories and tools;</p></li>
<li><p>Use and inclusion of data sharing, data repositories, curation, and/or creation of open data;</p></li>
<li><p>Use and inclusion of with open-access publishing, pre-publication, peer review, academic review and/or tenure processes, replication and reproducibility in scientific results, and virtual research environments;</p></li>
<li><p>Participation or leadership in open science communities;</p></li>
<li><p>Participation or leadership in diverse communities dedicated to advancing diversity in STEM, diversity in academia; and,</p></li>
<li><p>Participation or leadership in community organizing around equity and inclusion in STEM, climate justice, or citizen science.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Open science is reliant upon teamwork, and recognizes that the different experiences we bring to the table strengthens a project. Consider creating a team award, rather than one that implies individual merit.</p></li>

<h3>Sponsor a Grand Challenge<a class="headerlink" href="#sponsor-a-grand-challenge" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>
<p>To solve the biggest challenges faced in our world today–such as climate change, extreme weather, endemic COVID-19–we need everyone, from all walks of life and with all academic experiences. The sharing of data, results, code, and policy during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the impact and effectiveness of openly sharing research. What other grand challenges could we solve if we were dedicated to solving them using principles of open science?</p>
<p><strong>How do I get started?</strong></p>
